 273 it has become apparent that the franchise 's best years are long past . 1
 274 screenwriter chris ver weil 's directing debut is good-natured and never dull , but its virtues are small and easily overshadowed by its predictability . 2
 275 too much of storytelling moves away from solondz 's social critique , casting its audience as that of intellectual lector in contemplation of the auteur 's professional injuries . 1
 276 ultimately , sarah 's dedication to finding her husband seems more psychotic than romantic , and nothing in the movie makes a convincing case that one woman 's broken heart outweighs all the loss we witness . 1
 277 the jokes are flat , and the action looks fake . 0
 278 a mildly enjoyable if toothless adaptation of a much better book . 2
 279 festers in just such a dungpile that you 'd swear you were watching monkeys flinging their feces at you . 0
 280 in addition to the overcooked , ham-fisted direction , which has all the actors reaching for the back row , the dialogue sounds like horrible poetry . 0
 281 a vile , incoherent mess ... a scummy ripoff of david cronenberg 's brilliant ` videodrome . ' 0

 294 `` austin_powers in goldmember '' has the right stuff for silly summer entertainment and has enough laughs to sustain interest to the end . 4
 295 what puzzles me is the lack of emphasis on music in britney spears ' first movie . 2
 296 the filmmakers might want to look it up . 2
 297 while maintaining the appearance of clinical objectivity , this sad , occasionally horrifying but often inspiring film is among wiseman 's warmest . 4
 298 there is simply no_doubt that this film asks the right questions at the right time in the history of our country . 4
 299 a dreary movie . 0
 300 sadly , though many of the actors throw off a spark or two when they first appear , they ca_n't generate enough heat in this cold vacuum of a comedy to start a reaction . 1
 301 to the filmmakers , ivan is a prince of a fellow , but he comes_across as shallow and glib though not mean-spirited , and there 's no indication that he 's been responsible for putting together any movies of particular value or merit . 1
 302 using a stock plot , about a boy injects just enough freshness into the proceedings to provide an enjoyable 100 minutes in a movie theater . 3
 303 beating the austin_powers films at their own game , this blaxploitation spoof downplays the raunch in favor of gags that rely on the strength of their own cleverness as opposed to the extent of their outrageousness . 3
 304 what begins as a conventional thriller evolves into a gorgeously atmospheric meditation_on life-changing chance encounters . 3

 306 a late-night cable sexploitation romp masquerading as a thriller about the ruthless social order that governs college cliques . 2
 307 a well-intentioned effort that 's still too burdened by the actor 's offbeat sensibilities for the earnest emotional core to emerge with any degree of accessibility . 1
 308 -lrb- allen 's -rrb- been making piffle for a long while , and hollywood_ending may be his way of saying that piffle is all that the airhead movie business deserves from him right now . 2
 309 seeing as the film lacks momentum and its position remains mostly undeterminable , the director 's experiment is a successful one . 3
 310 judith and zaza 's extended bedroom sequence ... is so intimate and sensual and funny and psychologically self-revealing that it makes most of what passes for sex in the movies look like cheap hysterics . 4

 334 leigh is one of the rare directors who feels acting is the heart and soul of cinema . 4

 342 with wit and empathy to spare , waydowntown acknowledges the silent screams of workaday inertia but stops short of indulging its characters ' striving solipsism . 2
 343 it labours as storytelling . 1
 344 remember back when thrillers actually thrilled ? 1
 345 the otherwise good-naturedness of mr. deeds , with its embrace of sheer goofiness and cameos of less - than-likely new_york celebrities ... certainly raises the film above anything sandler 's been attached to before . 3
 346 fails so fundamentally on every conventional level that it achieves some kind of goofy grandeur . 1
 347 ... a ho-hum affair , always watchable yet hardly memorable . 2
 348 i just saw this movie ... well , it 's probably not accurate to call it a movie . 1
 349 though uniformly well acted , especially by young ballesta and galan -lrb- a first-time actor -rrb- , writer\/director achero manas 's film is schematic and obvious . 2
 350 when you resurrect a dead man , hard copy should come a-knocking , no ? 2
 351 if the idea of the white man arriving on foreign shores to show wary natives the true light is abhorrent to you , the simplistic heaven will quite likely be more like hell . 2
 352 it 's hard to believe that a relationship like holly and marina 's could survive the hothouse emotions of teendom , and its longevity gets more inexplicable as the characterizations turn more crassly reductive . 2
 353 for a movie audience , the hours does_n't connect in a neat way , but introduces characters who illuminate mysteries of sex , duty and love . 2
 354 purports to be a hollywood satire but winds_up as the kind of film that should be the target of something deeper and more engaging . 1

 373 less front-loaded and more shapely than the two-hour version released here in 1990 . 2
 374 an ambitious movie that , like shiner 's organizing of the big fight , pulls off enough of its effects to make up for the ones that do_n't come off . 4

 376 very well written and directed with brutal honesty and respect for its audience . 4

 423 here 's a case of two actors who do everything humanly possible to create characters who are sweet and believable , and are defeated by a screenplay that forces them into bizarre , implausible behavior . 1
 424 any enjoyment will be hinge from a personal threshold of watching sad but endearing characters do extremely unconventional things . 3
 425 some body smacks of exhibitionism more than it does cathartic truth telling . 1
 426 though writer\/director bart freundlich 's film ultimately becomes a simplistic story about a dysfunctional parent-child relationship , it has some special qualities and the soulful gravity of crudup 's anchoring performance . 3

 433 a serviceable euro-trash action extravaganza , with a decent sense of humor and plenty of things that go boom -- handguns , bmws and seaside chateaus . 2
 434 veterans of the dating wars will smirk uneasily at the film 's nightmare versions of everyday sex-in-the-city misadventures . 2
 435 it sends you away a believer again and quite cheered at just that . 4
 436 the rollerball sequences feel sanitised and stagey . 1
 437 interview with the assassin is structured less as a documentary and more as a found relic , and as such the film has a difficult time shaking its blair_witch project real-time roots . 1
 438 it is most remarkable not because of its epic scope , but because of the startling intimacy it achieves despite that breadth . 4
 439 a nearly 21\/2 hours , the film is way too indulgent . 1
 440 seems like something american and european gay movies were doing 20_years ago . 1

 459 too long , and larded with exposition , this somber cop drama ultimately feels as flat as the scruffy sands of its titular community . 1

 496 even in the summertime , the most restless young audience deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise possibilities . 1
 497 perfectly pitched between comedy and tragedy , hope and despair , about_schmidt instead comes far closer than many movies to expressing the way many of us live -- someplace between consuming self-absorption and insistently demanding otherness . 4
 498 she nearly glows with enthusiasm , sensuality and a conniving wit . 3
 499 despite modest aspirations its occasional charms are not to be dismissed . 3
 500 so exaggerated and broad that it comes_off as annoying rather_than charming . 1

 502 the film has the thrown-together feel of a summer-camp talent show : hastily written , underrehearsed , arbitrarily plotted and filled_with crude humor and vulgar innuendo . 1
 503 the cast comes through even when the movie does_n't . 2
 504 a rock-solid gangster movie with a fair amount of suspense , intriguing characters and bizarre bank robberies , plus a heavy dose of father-and-son dynamics . 3
 505 it 's both degrading and strangely liberating to see people working so hard at leading lives of sexy intrigue , only to be revealed by the dispassionate gantz brothers as ordinary , pasty lumpen . 3
 506 innocuous enough to make even jean-claude van damme look good . 2
 507 but if the essence of magic is its make-believe promise of life that soars above the material realm , this is the opposite of a truly magical movie . 0
 508 but its storytelling prowess and special_effects are both listless . 1
 509 i stopped thinking about how good it all was , and started doing nothing but reacting to it - feeling a part of its grand locations , thinking urgently as the protagonists struggled , feeling at the mercy of its inventiveness , gasping at its visual delights . 4
 510 newcomer helmer kevin donovan is hamstrung by a badly handled screenplay of what is really an amusing concept -- a high-tech tux that transforms its wearer into a superman . 2
 511 one hour photo may seem disappointing in its generalities , but it 's the little nuances that perhaps had to escape from director mark romanek 's self-conscious scrutiny to happen , that finally get under your skin . 1

 515 proves a lovely trifle that , unfortunately , is a little too in love with its own cuteness . 1
 516 so purely enjoyable that you might not even notice it 's a fairly straightforward remake of hollywood comedies such as father of the bride . 3
 517 an intelligent , multi-layered and profoundly humanist -lrb- not to mention gently political -rrb- meditation_on the values of knowledge , education , and the affects of cultural and geographical displacement . 4
 518 i_'m not sure which is worse : the poor acting by the ensemble_cast , the flat dialogue by vincent r. nebrida or the gutless direction by laurice guillen . 0

 521 goldmember has none of the visual wit of the previous pictures , and it looks as though jay roach directed the film from the back of a taxicab . 0

 531 combines improbable melodrama -lrb- gored bullfighters , comatose ballerinas -rrb- with subtly kinky bedside vigils and sensational denouements , and yet at the end , we are undeniably touched . 3
 532 this is one of mr. chabrol 's subtlest works , but also one of his most uncanny . 3
 533 this one is strictly a lightweight escapist film . 2
 534 it 's actually too sincere -- the crime movie equivalent of a chick flick . 2
 535 if the title is a jeopardy question , then the answer might be `` how does steven seagal come across these_days ? '' 1
 536 unambitious writing emerges in the movie , using a plot that could have come from an animated-movie screenwriting textbook . 1
 537 not that any of us should be complaining when a film clocks in around 90_minutes these_days , but the plotting here leaves a lot to be desired . 1

 948 it 's a piece of handiwork that shows its indie tatters and self-conscious seams in places , but has some quietly moving moments and an intelligent subtlety . 3
 949 i was amused and entertained by the unfolding of bielinsky 's cleverly constructed scenario , and greatly impressed by the skill of the actors involved in the enterprise . 4
 950 for most of the distance the picture provides a satisfyingly unsettling ride into the dark places of our national psyche . 3
 951 with very little to add beyond the dark visions already relayed by superb recent predecessors like swimming with sharks and the player , this latest skewering ... may put off insiders and outsiders alike . 1

 964 this one is not nearly as dreadful as expected . 3
 965 but ... in trying to capture the novel 's deeper intimate resonances , the film has -- ironically - distanced us from the characters . 1

 974 it makes sense that he went back to school to check out the girls -- his film is a frat boy 's idea of a good time . 2
 975 clever but not especially compelling . 2
 976 an exit sign , that is . 1
 977 it 's an actor 's showcase that accomplishes its primary goal without the use of special_effects , but rather by emphasizing the characters -- including the supporting ones . 2

 1016 well , they 're ` they ' . 2
 1017 any attempts at nuance given by the capable cast is drowned out by director jon purdy 's sledgehammer sap . 1
 1018 -lrb- a -rrb- wonderfully loopy tale of love , longing , and voting . 4
 1019 the characters , cast in impossibly contrived situations , are totally estranged from reality . 1
 1020 for every cheesy scene , though , there is a really cool bit -- the movie 's conception of a future-world holographic librarian -lrb- orlando jones -rrb- who knows everything and answers all questions , is visually smart , cleverly written , and nicely realized . 3
 1021 the mark of a respectable summer blockbuster is one of two things : unadulterated thrills or genuine laughs . 4
 1022 as a hybrid teen thriller and murder mystery , murder by numbers fits the profile too closely . 2

 1031 an enigmatic film that 's too clever for its own good , it 's a conundrum not worth solving . 2
 1032 the fascination comes in the power of the huston performance , which seems so larger than life and yet so fragile , and in the way the ivan character accepts the news of his illness so quickly but still finds himself unable to react . 3

 1609 watching harris ham it up while physically and emotionally disintegrating over the course of the movie has a certain poignancy in light of his recent death , but boyd 's film offers little else of consequence . 2
 1610 as quiet , patient and tenacious as mr. lopez himself , who approaches his difficult , endless work with remarkable serenity and discipline . 4
 1611 hugely entertaining from start to finish , featuring a fall from grace that still leaves shockwaves , it will gratify anyone_who has ever suspected hollywood of being overrun by corrupt and hedonistic weasels . 4
 1612 squandering his opportunity to make absurdist observations , burns gets caught up in the rush of slapstick thoroughfare . 1
 1613 topics that could make a sailor blush - but lots of laughs . 4
 1614 it 's so laddish and juvenile , only teenage boys could possibly find it funny . 2
 1615 one of those movies that make us pause and think of what we have given up to acquire the fast-paced contemporary society . 3
 1616 a loud , brash and mainly unfunny high_school comedy . 0
 1617 ... one of the most entertaining monster movies in ages ... 4
 1618 the movie 's something-borrowed construction feels less the product of loving , well integrated homage and more like a mere excuse for the wan , thinly sketched story . 1
 1619 with tiny little jokes and nary an original idea , this sappy ethnic sleeper proves that not only blockbusters pollute the summer movie pool . 1
 1620 the movie keeps coming back to the achingly unfunny phonce and his several silly subplots . 1
 1621 ... a mostly boring affair with a confusing sudden finale that 's likely to irk viewers . 2
 1622 a reality-snubbing hodgepodge . 1
 1623 ... grows decidedly flimsier with its many out-sized , out of character and logically porous action set pieces . 0
 1624 the humor and humanity of monsoon wedding are in perfect balance . 3
 1625 there are things to like about murder by numbers -- but , in the end , the disparate elements do_n't gel . 2
 1626 quaid is utterly fearless as the tortured husband living a painful lie , and moore wonderfully underplays the long-suffering heroine with an unflappable '50s dignity somewhere between jane wyman and june cleaver . 3
 1627 what begins as a film in the tradition of the graduate quickly switches into something more recyclable than significant . 2
 1628 apparently reassembled from the cutting-room floor of any given daytime soap . 1
 1629 a brisk , reverent , and subtly different sequel . 4
 1630 the story , once it gets rolling , is nothing short of a great one . 4
 1631 it 's not the worst comedy of the year , but it certainly wo_n't win any honors . 2
 1632 some people want the ol' ball-and-chain and then there are those who just want the ball and chain . 2
 1633 one of the funnier movies in town . 4
 1634 the universal theme of becoming a better person through love has never been filmed more irresistibly than in ` baran . ' 4
 1635 american and european cinema has amassed a vast holocaust literature , but it is impossible to think of any film more challenging or depressing than the grey zone . 1
 1636 an elegant film 2
 1637 an example of quiet , confident craftsmanship that tells a sweet , charming tale of intergalactic friendship . 4
 1638 a plodding teen remake that 's so mechanical you can smell the grease on the plot_twists . 0
 1639 a stylistic romp that 's always fun to watch . 4
 1640 like its title_character , this nicholas_nickleby finds itself in reduced circumstances -- and , also like its hero , it remains brightly optimistic , coming through in the end . 3
 1641 although mainstream american movies tend to exploit the familiar , every once in a while a film arrives from the margin that gives viewers a chance to learn , to grow , to travel . 3
 1642 film ca_n't quite maintain its initial momentum , but remains sporadically funny throughout . 2
 1643 it seems impossible that an epic four-hour indian musical about a cricket game could be this good , but it is . 3
 1644 a zinger-filled crowd-pleaser that open-minded elvis fans -lrb- but by no means all -rrb- will have fun with . 4
 1645 kicks off with an inauspicious premise , mopes through a dreary tract of virtually plotless meanderings and then ends with a whimper . 1
 1646 most of the problems with the film do_n't derive from the screenplay , but rather the mediocre performances by most of the actors involved 0
 1647 there 's no conversion effort , much of the writing is genuinely witty and both stars are appealing enough to probably have a good shot at a hollywood career , if they want one . 3
 1648 the movie turns out to be -lrb- assayas ' -rrb- homage to the gallic ` tradition of quality , ' in all its fusty squareness . 1
 1649 mattei so completely loses himself to the film 's circular structure to ever offer any insightful discourse on , well , love in the time of money . 1
 1650 returning director rob minkoff ... and screenwriter bruce joel rubin ... have done a fine job of updating white 's dry wit to a new age . 4
 1651 the film has a laundry list of minor shortcomings , but the numerous scenes of gory mayhem are worth the price of admission ... if `` gory mayhem '' is your idea of a good time . 3
 1652 that is because - damn it ! 2
 1653 it would be great to see this turd squashed under a truck , preferably a semi . 0
 1654 what a vast enterprise has been marshaled in the service of such a minute idea . 2
 1655 this may be burns 's strongest film since the brothers mcmullen . 4
 1656 no better or worse than ` truth or consequences , n.m. ' or any other interchangeable actioner with imbecilic mafia toolbags botching a routine assignment in a western backwater . 1
 1657 deliciously mean-spirited and wryly observant . 3
 1658 when twentysomething hotsies make movies about their lives , hard-driving narcissism is a given , but what a world we 'd live in if argento 's hollywood counterparts ... had this much imagination and nerve . 3
 1659 but it 's worth the concentration . 3
 1660 despite its promising cast of characters , big trouble remains a loosely tied series of vignettes which only prove that ` zany ' does_n't necessarily mean ` funny . ' 1
 1661 but the second half of the movie really goes downhill . 0
 1662 it is supremely unfunny and unentertaining to watch middle-age and older men drink to excess , piss on trees , b.s. one another and put on a show in drag . 0
 1663 the big finish is a bit like getting all excited about a chocolate eclair and then biting into it and finding the filling missing . 1
 1664 a good music documentary , probably one of the best since the last waltz . 4
 1665 it is a movie about passion . 2
 1666 certainly . 2
 1667 but what 's nice is that there 's a casual intelligence that permeates the script . 4
 1668 lush and beautifully photographed -lrb- somebody suggested the stills might make a nice coffee table book -rrb- , but ultimately you_'ll leave the theater wondering why these people mattered . 1
 1669 ... another example of how sandler is losing his touch . 1
 1670 this is an undeniably intriguing film from an adventurous young talent who finds his inspiration on the fringes of the american underground . 4
 1671 a fleet-footed and pleasingly upbeat family diversion . 3
 1672 efficient , suitably anonymous chiller . 3
 1673 this follow-up seems so similar to the 1953 disney classic that it makes one long for a geriatric peter . 2
 1674 the movie 's plot is almost entirely witless and inane , carrying every gag two or three times beyond its limit to sustain a laugh . 0
 1675 this movie is so bad , that it 's almost worth_seeing because it 's so bad . 1
 1676 gently humorous and touching . 3
 1677 at its worst , the movie is pretty diverting ; the pity is that it rarely achieves its best . 2
 1678 it cuts to the core of what it actually means to face your fears , to be a girl in a world of boys , to be a boy truly in love with a girl , and to ride the big metaphorical wave that is life -- wherever it takes you . 4
 1679 spider-man is in the same category as x-men - occasionally brilliant but mostly average , showing signs of potential for the sequels , but not giving us much this time around . 2
 1680 when the twist endings were actually surprising ? 2
 1681 much of the cast is stiff or just_plain bad . 1
 1682 the last three narcissists left on earth compete for each others ' affections . 2
 1683 represents a worthy departure from the culture clash comedies that have marked an emerging indian american cinema . 3
 1684 a compelling film . 4
 1685 the movie is well done , but slow . 1
 1686 it is up to you to decide if you need to see it . 2
 1687 yet in its own aloof , unreachable way it 's so fascinating you wo_n't be able to look away for a second . 3
 1688 `` bad '' is the operative word for `` bad company , '' and i do_n't mean that in a good way . 0
 1689 i_'m not a fan of the phrase ` life affirming ' because it usually means ` schmaltzy , ' but real_women have curves truly is life affirming . 3
 1690 no one can doubt the filmmakers ' motives , but the guys still feels counterproductive . 1
 1691 offers a clear-eyed chronicle of a female friendship that is more complex and honest than anything represented in a hollywood film . 4
 1692 the worst film of the year . 0
 1693 ` christian bale 's quinn -lrb- is -rrb- a leather clad grunge-pirate with a hairdo like gandalf in a wind-tunnel and a simply astounding cor-blimey-luv-a-duck cockney accent . ' 1
 1694 the only thing scary about feardotcom is that the filmmakers and studio are brazen enough to attempt to pass this stinker off as a scary movie . 0
 1695 throwing it all away for the fleeting joys of love 's brief moment . 2
 1696 take away the controversy , and it 's not much more watchable than a mexican soap_opera . 0
 1697 a raunchy and frequently hilarious follow-up to the gifted korean american stand-up 's i_'m the one that i want . 3
 1698 painful , horrifying and oppressively tragic , this film should not be missed . 4
 1699 the most brilliant and brutal uk crime film since jack carter went back to newcastle , the first half of gangster no. 1 drips with style and , at_times , blood . 4
 1700 yes , i suppose it 's lovely that cal works out his issues with his dad and comes to terms with his picture-perfect life -- but world_traveler gave me no reason to care , so i did_n't . 0
 1701 broomfield is energized by volletta wallace 's maternal fury , her fearlessness , and because of that , his film crackles . 4
 1702 yet the act is still charming here . 3
 1703 the plot 's contrivances are uncomfortably strained . 1
 1704 it has that rare quality of being able to creep the living hell out of you ... 4
 1705 he drags it back , single-handed . 3
 1706 it may not be `` last tango in paris '' but ... 2
 1707 a `` home alone '' film that is staged like `` rosemary 's baby , '' but is not as well-conceived as either of those films . 1
 1708 a rather average action film that benefits from several funny moments supplied by epps . 2
 1709 of whimsicality , narrative discipline and serious improvisation 3
 1710 often hilarious . 3
 1711 i_'m convinced i could keep a family of five blind , crippled , amish people alive in this situation better than these british soldiers do at keeping themselves kicking . 1
 1712 an elegant work , food of love is as consistently engaging as it is revealing . 3
 1713 the jokes are telegraphed so far in advance they must have_been lost in the mail . 1
 1714 give shapiro , goldman , and bolado credit for good_intentions , but there 's nothing here that they could n't have done in half an hour . 1
 1715 ... this is n't even a movie we can enjoy as mild escapism ; it is one in which fear and frustration are provoked to intolerable levels . 0
 1716 it 's good , hard-edged stuff , violent and a bit exploitative but also nicely done , morally alert and street-smart . 3
 1717 i like it . 3
 1718 on its own , big trouble could be considered a funny little film . 3
 1719 it 's not nearly as fresh or enjoyable as its predecessor , but there are enough high points to keep this from being a complete waste of time . 3
 1720 this tale has been told and retold ; the races and rackets change , but the song remains the same . 1
 1721 worthless , from its pseudo-rock-video opening to the idiocy of its last frames . 0
 1722 makes a joke out of car chases for an hour and then gives us half an hour of car chases . 0
 1723 a knowing sense of humor and a lot of warmth ignite son of the bride . 4
 1724 though there are entertaining and audacious moments , the movie 's wildly careening tone and an extremely flat lead performance do little to salvage this filmmaker 's flailing reputation . 1
 1725 the son of the bride 's humour is born out of an engaging storyline , which also is n't embarrassed to make you reach for the tissues . 4
 1726 even_if the naipaul original remains the real masterpiece , the movie possesses its own languorous charm . 4
 1727 ambitious , unsettling psychodrama that takes full , chilling advantage of its rough-around-the-edges , low-budget constraints . 3
 1728 most of the things that made the original men in black such a pleasure are still there . 3
 1729 at times a bit melodramatic and even a little dated -lrb- depending upon where you live -rrb- , ignorant fairies is still quite good-natured and not a bad way to spend an hour or two . 3
 1730 or for the year , for that matter . 2
 1731 i had more fun watching spy than i had with most of the big summer movies . 4
 1732 it 's just merely very bad . 0
 1733 the shackles 2
 1734 watching this gentle , mesmerizing portrait of a man coming to terms with time , you barely realize your mind is being blown . 3
 1735 you can watch , giggle and get an adrenaline boost without feeling like you 've completely lowered your entertainment standards . 3
 1736 some movies blend together as they become distant memories . 2
 1737 nair just does_n't have the necessary self-control to guide a loose , poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy . 0
 1738 chouraqui brings documentary-like credibility to the horrors of the killing field and the barbarism of ` ethnic cleansing . ' 3
 1739 woody_allen used to ridicule movies like hollywood_ending . 1
 1740 it 's mildly amusing , but i certainly ca_n't recommend it . 1
 1741 and it 's not that funny -- which is just generally insulting . 0
 1742 as david letterman and the onion have proven , the worst of tragedies can be fertile sources of humor , but lawrence has only a fleeting grasp of how to develop them . 0
 1743 they just have problems , which are neither original nor are presented in convincing way . 1
 1744 for all the dolorous trim , secretary is a genial romance that maintains a surprisingly buoyant tone throughout , notwithstanding some of the writers ' sporadic dips into pop freudianism . 3
 1745 like the original , this version is raised a few notches above kiddie fantasy pablum by allen 's astringent wit . 3
 1746 a taut , sobering film . 4
 1747 far-fetched premise , convoluted plot , and thematic mumbo jumbo about destiny and redemptive love . 2
 1748 a muddle splashed with bloody beauty as vivid as any scorsese has ever given us . 3
 1749 the way the roundelay of partners functions , and the interplay within partnerships and among partnerships and the general air of gator-bashing are consistently delightful . 4
 1750 but while the highly predictable narrative falls_short , treasure planet is truly gorgeous to behold . 4
 1751 directed with purpose and finesse by england 's roger mitchell , who handily makes the move from pleasing , relatively lightweight commercial fare such as notting hill to commercial fare with real thematic heft . 4
 1752 one of these_days hollywood will come up with an original idea for a teen movie , but until then there 's always these rehashes to feed to the younger generations . 1
 1753 a wild ride juiced with enough energy and excitement for at_least three films . 3
 1754 nemesis suffers_from a paunchy midsection , several plodding action_sequences and a wickedly undramatic central theme . 1
 1755 lucky break is perfectly inoffensive and harmless , but it 's also drab and inert . 2
 1756 elvira fans could hardly ask for more . 4
 1757 exactly what you 'd_expect from a guy named kaos . 2
 1758 like all great films about a life you never knew existed , it offers much to absorb and even more to think about after the final frame . 4
 1759 it 's pretentious in a way that verges on the amateurish . 0
 1760 ... unlike -lrb- scorsese 's mean streets -rrb- , ash wednesday is essentially devoid of interesting characters or even a halfway intriguing plot . 0
 1761 only two-fifths of a satisfying movie experience . 2
 1762 ... the good and different idea -lrb- of middle-aged romance -rrb- is not handled well and , except for the fine star performances , there is little else to recommend `` never again . '' 1
 1763 murder by numbers ' is n't a great movie , but it 's a perfectly acceptable widget . 2
 1764 it may as well be called `` jar-jar binks : the movie . '' 0
 1765 but it would be better to wait for the video . 1
 1766 delirious fun . 4
 1767 there are some fairly unsettling scenes , but they never succeed in really rattling the viewer . 1
 1768 special p.o.v. camera mounts on bikes , skateboards , and motorcycles provide an intense experience when splashed across the immense imax screen . 4
 1769 there are scenes of cinematic perfection that steal your heart away . 4
 1770 a fantastic premise anchors this movie , but what it needs is either a more rigid , blair witch-style commitment to its mockumentary format , or a more straightforward , dramatic treatment , with all the grandiosity that that implies . 2
 1771 `` interview '' loses its overall sense of mystery and becomes a tv episode rather_than a documentary that you actually buy into . 0
 1772 ... the first 2\/3 of the film are incredibly captivating and insanely funny , thanks in part to interesting cinematic devices -lrb- cool visual backmasking -rrb- , a solid cast , and some wickedly sick and twisted humor ... 4
 1773 this is the best star trek movie in a long time . 4
 1774 auto focus is not your standard hollywood bio-pic . 2
 1775 `` not really as bad as you might think ! '' 2
 1776 beautifully filmed and well acted ... but admittedly problematic in its narrative specifics . 3
 1777 brainless , but enjoyably over-the-top , the retro gang melodrama , deuces_wild represents fifties teen-gang machismo in a way that borders on rough-trade homo-eroticism . 1
 1778 one of the best films of the year with its exquisite acting , inventive screenplay , mesmerizing music , and many inimitable scenes of tenderness , loss , discontent , and yearning . 4
 1779 i_saw juwanna mann so you do_n't have to . 2
 1780 why anyone_who is not a character in this movie should care is beyond me . 0
 1781 what starts off as a potentially incredibly twisting mystery becomes simply a monster chase film . 1
 1782 ... they missed the boat . 2
 1783 characterisation has been sacrificed for the sake of spectacle . 0
 1784 as an introduction to the man 's theories and influence , derrida is all but useless ; as a portrait of the artist as an endlessly inquisitive old man , however , it 's invaluable . 3
 1785 a delightful , if minor , pastry of a movie . 4
 1786 ... despite lagging near the finish line , the movie runs a good race , one that will have you at the edge of your_seat for long stretches . ' 3
 1787 clockstoppers is one of those crazy , mixed-up films that does_n't know what it wants to be when it grows up . 1
 1788 fear dot com is more frustrating than a modem that disconnects every 10 seconds . 1
 1789 and vin diesel is the man . 3
 1790 nights feels more like a quickie tv special than a feature film ... it 's not even a tv special you 'd bother watching past the second commercial break . 1
 1791 while there are times when the film 's reach exceeds its grasp , the production works more often than it does_n't . 3
 1792 richly entertaining and suggestive of any number of metaphorical readings . 4
 1793 it 's a day at the beach -- with air conditioning and popcorn . 3
 1794 ... a bland , pretentious mess . 1
 1795 the actors try hard but come off too amateurish and awkward . 0
 1796 goldbacher draws on an elegant visual sense and a talent for easy , seductive pacing ... but she and writing partner laurence coriat do_n't manage an equally assured narrative coinage . 3
 1797 the film would have_been more enjoyable had the balance shifted in favor of water-bound action over the land-based ` drama , ' but the emphasis on the latter leaves blue_crush waterlogged . 1
 1798 becomes a fascinating study of isolation and frustration that successfully recreates both the physical setting and emotional tensions of the papin sisters . 3
 1799 though harris is affecting at_times , he can not overcome the sense that pumpkin is a mere plot pawn for two directors with far less endearing disabilities . 1
 1800 the overall result is an intelligent , realistic portrayal of testing boundaries . 4
 1801 never decides whether it wants to be a black comedy , drama , melodrama or some combination of the three . 1
 1802 an authentically vague , but ultimately purposeless , study in total pandemonium . 1
 1803 ` tadpole ' was one of the films so declared this year , but it 's really more of the next pretty good thing . 2
 1804 those prone to indignation need not apply ; those susceptible to blue hilarity , step right up . 3
 1805 she 's as rude and profane as ever , always hilarious and , most of the time , absolutely right in her stinging social observations . 4
 1806 even as i valiantly struggled to remain interested , or at_least conscious , i could feel my eyelids ... getting ... very ... heavy ... 0
 1807 it may not be particularly innovative , but the film 's crisp , unaffected style and air of gentle longing make it unexpectedly rewarding . 3
 1808 at its best ... festival in cannes bubbles with the excitement of the festival in cannes . 2
 1809 bill morrison 's decasia is uncompromising , difficult and unbearably beautiful . 4
 1810 -lrb- shyamalan -rrb- turns the goose-pimple genre on its empty head and fills it with spirit , purpose and emotionally bruised characters who add_up to more than body count . 3
 1811 i_'d be hard pressed to think of a film more cloyingly sappy than evelyn this year . 1
 1812 i know that i 'll never listen to marvin gaye or the supremes the same way again 3
 1813 like shrek , spirit 's visual imagination reminds you of why animation is such a perfect medium for children , because of the way it allows the mind to enter and accept another world . 4
 1814 saddled with an unwieldy cast of characters and angles , but the payoff is powerful and revelatory . 3
 1815 i 'll stay with the stage versions , however , which bite cleaner , and deeper . 1
 1816 tsai convincingly paints a specifically urban sense of disassociation here . 3
 1817 despite the opulent lushness of every scene , the characters never seem to match the power of their surroundings . 1
 1818 and people make fun of me for liking showgirls . 1
 1819 you just know something terrible is going to happen . 2
 1820 much of what we see is horrible but it 's also undeniably exceedingly clever . 3
 1821 writer \/ director m. night shyamalan 's ability to pull together easily accessible stories that resonate with profundity is undeniable . 3
 1822 not once in the rush to save the day did i become very involved in the proceedings ; to me , it was just a matter of ` eh . ' 1
 1823 this 10th film in the series looks and feels tired . 1
 1824 a long , dull procession of despair , set to cello music culled from a minimalist funeral . 0
 1825 cherish is a dud -- a romantic_comedy that 's not the least bit romantic and only mildly funny . 1
 1826 is now stretched to barely feature length , with a little more attention paid to the animation . 2
 1827 for most movies , 84 minutes is short , but this one feels like a life sentence . 0
 1828 the movie 's major and most devastating flaw is its reliance on formula , though , and it 's quite enough to lessen the overall impact the movie could have had . 1
 1829 for a movie about the power of poetry and passion , there is precious little of either . 1
 1830 not to mention a sharper , cleaner camera lens . 2
 1831 would have_been benefited from a sharper , cleaner script before it went in front of the camera . 2
 1832 this tuxedo ... should have_been sent back to the tailor for some major alterations . 0
 1833 if_you 're as happy listening to movies as you are watching them , and the slow parade of human frailty fascinates you , then you_'re at the right film . 3
 1834 poignant and delicately complex . 3
 1835 intriguing and stylish . 4
 1836 it was filled_with shootings , beatings , and more cussing than you could shake a stick at . 2
 1837 it 's a mindless action flick with a twist -- far better suited to video-viewing than the multiplex . 1
 1838 the trick when watching godard is to catch the pitch of his poetics , savor the pleasure of his sounds and images , and ponder the historical , philosophical , and ethical issues that intersect with them . 3
 1839 a biopic about crane 's life in the classic tradition but evolves into what has become of us all in the era of video . 2
 1840 with exquisite craftsmanship ... olivier assayas has fashioned an absorbing look_at provincial bourgeois french society . 3
 1841 however sincere it may be , the rising place never_quite justifies its own existence . 1
 1842 the central character is n't complex enough to hold our interest . 2
 1843 what could have_been right at home as a nifty plot line in steven_soderbergh 's traffic fails to arrive at any satisfying destination . 1
 1844 tykwer 's surface flash is n't just a poor fit with kieslowski 's lyrical pessimism ; it completely contradicts everything kieslowski 's work aspired to , including the condition of art . 0
 1845 skip this turd and pick your nose instead because you_'re sure to get more out of the latter experience . 0
 1846 you get the idea , though , that kapur intended the film to be more than that . 2
 1847 o.k. , not really . 2
 1848 both deserve better . 1
 1849 parents may even find that it goes by quickly , because it has some of the funniest jokes of any movie this year , including those intended for adults . 4
 1850 a tasty appetizer that leaves you wanting more . 3
 1851 the film has too_many spots where it 's on slippery footing , but is acceptable entertainment for the entire family and one that 's especially fit for the kiddies . 2
 1852 two hours of sepia-tinted heavy metal images and surround sound effects of people moaning . 2
 1853 even kids deserve better . 1
 1854 that the real antwone_fisher was able to overcome his personal obstacles and become a good man is a wonderful thing ; that he has been able to share his story so compellingly with us is a minor miracle . 4
 1855 meticulously mounted , exasperatingly well-behaved film , which ticks off kahlo 's lifetime milestones with the dutiful precision of a tax accountant . 3
 1856 men in black ii achieves ultimate insignificance -- it 's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as whiffle-ball epic . 0
 1857 those unfamiliar with mormon traditions may find the singles ward occasionally bewildering . 2
 1858 stiff and schmaltzy and clumsily directed . 0
 1859 if the last man were the last movie left on earth , there would be a toss-up between presiding over the end of cinema as we know it and another night of delightful hand shadows . 1
 1860 `` i blame all men for war , '' -lrb- the warden 's daughter -rrb- tells her father . 2
 1861 if_you do_n't laugh , flee . 2
 1862 that it 'll probably be the best and most mature comedy of the 2002 summer season speaks more of the season than the picture 3
 1863 on its own , it 's not very interesting . 1
 1864 leigh is n't breaking new ground , but he knows_how a daily grind can kill love . 3
 1865 the rich performances by friel -- and especially williams , an american actress who becomes fully english -- round out the square edges . 3
 1866 the appeal of the vulgar , sexist , racist humour went over my head or -- considering just how low brow it is -- perhaps it snuck under my feet . 0
 1867 the movie itself is far from disappointing , offering an original take on courtroom movies , a few nifty twists that are so crucial to the genre and another first-rate performance by top-billed star bruce willis . 3
 1868 five screenwriters 2
 1869 about half of them are funny , a few are sexy and none are useful in telling the story , which is paper-thin and decidedly unoriginal . 1

 2959 earnest but heavy-handed . 2
 2960 until it goes off the rails in its final 10 or 15 minutes , wendigo , larry fessenden 's spooky new thriller , is a refreshingly smart and newfangled variation on several themes derived from far less sophisticated and knowing horror films . 3
 2961 -lrb- moore 's -rrb- better at fingering problems than finding solutions . 1
 2962 but for the most part , the weight of water comes_off as a two-way time-switching myopic mystery that stalls in its lackluster gear of emotional blandness . 1

 2968 the only type of lives this glossy comedy-drama resembles are ones in formulaic mainstream movies . 1
 2969 surprisingly , the film is a hilarious adventure and i shamelessly enjoyed it . 3
 2970 a clumsily manufactured exploitation flick , a style-free exercise in manipulation and mayhem . 1

 2984 this scarlet 's letter is a. . . 2
 2985 i prefer soderbergh 's concentration on his two lovers over tarkovsky 's mostly male , mostly patriarchal debating societies . 2

 2988 a charming but slight comedy . 3
 2989 ... post-september 11 , `` the sum of all_fears '' seems more tacky and reprehensible , manipulating our collective fear without bestowing the subject with the intelligence or sincerity it unequivocally deserves . 0
 2990 a hit - and-miss affair , consistently amusing but not as outrageous or funny as cho may have intended or as imaginative as one might have hoped . 1
 2991 the setting is so cool that it chills the characters , reducing our emotional stake in the outcome of `` intacto 's '' dangerous and seductively stylish game . 2

 2995 slow , silly and unintentionally hilarious . 2
 2996 imamura has said that warm water under a red bridge is a poem to the enduring strengths of women . 3
 2997 thanks to a small star with big heart , this family film sequel is plenty of fun for all . 4
 2998 what makes the film special is the refreshingly unhibited enthusiasm that the people , in spite of clearly evident poverty and hardship , bring to their music . 3
 2999 the story the movie tells is of brian de_palma 's addiction to the junk-calorie suspense tropes that have all but ruined his career . 1
 3000 but the nerve-raked acting , the crackle of lines , the impressive stagings of hardware , make for some robust and scary entertainment . 4
 3001 a terrible adaptation of a play that only ever walked the delicate tightrope between farcical and loathsome . 0
 3002 even accepting this in the right frame of mind can only provide it with so much leniency . 1
 3003 a hypnotic cyber hymn and a cruel story of youth culture . 3
 3004 what soured me on the santa clause 2 was that santa bumps up against 21st century reality so hard , it 's icky . 0
 3005 often lingers just as long on the irrelevant as on the engaging , which gradually turns what time is it there ? 1
 3006 superb production_values & christian bale 's charisma make up for a derivative plot . 3
 3007 happy times maintains an appealing veneer without becoming too cute about it . 3
 3008 as a story of dramatic enlightenment , the screenplay by billy ray and terry george leaves something to be desired . 1
 3009 a bad movie that happened to good actors . 0
 3010 it 's a bad sign when you_'re rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects ' deaths just so the documentary will be over , but it 's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest . 0
 3011 confessions may not be a straightforward bio , nor does it offer much in the way of barris ' motivations , but the film is an oddly fascinating depiction of an architect of pop culture . 3

 3017 so beautifully acted and directed , it 's clear that washington most certainly has a new career ahead of him if he so chooses . 4
 3018 lovingly photographed in the manner of a golden book sprung to life , stuart little 2 manages sweetness largely without stickiness . 4
 3019 is the kind of movie that 's critic-proof , simply because it aims so low . 1

 3021 a delightful entree in the tradition of food movies . 4
 3022 spare but quietly effective retelling . 3
 3023 despite a performance of sustained intelligence from stanford and another of subtle humour from bebe neuwirth , as an older woman who seduces oscar , the film founders on its lack of empathy for the social milieu - rich new_york intelligentsia - and its off 2
 3024 though it flirts with bathos and pathos and the further oprahfication of the world as we know it , it still cuts all the way down to broken bone . 2
 3025 this is one baaaaaaaaad movie . 0
 3026 a delightful romantic_comedy with plenty of bite . 3
 3027 it must be the end of the world : the best film so far this year is a franchise sequel starring wesley snipes . 3
 3028 what -lrb- denis -rrb- accomplishes in his chilling , unnerving film is a double portrait of two young women whose lives were as claustrophic , suffocating and chilly as the attics to which they were inevitably consigned . 3
 3029 it is about irrational , unexplainable life and it seems so real because it does not attempt to filter out the complexity . 3
 3030 the writing is clever and the cast is appealing . 4
 3031 davis the performer is plenty fetching enough , but she needs to shake up the mix , and work in something that does_n't feel like a half-baked stand-up routine . 2
 3032 certainly the big finish was n't something galinsky and hawley could have planned for ... but part of being a good documentarian is being there when the rope snaps . 3
 3033 while easier to sit_through than most of jaglom 's self-conscious and gratingly irritating films , it 's still tainted by cliches , painful improbability and murky points . 1
 3034 poignant if familiar story of a young person suspended between two cultures . 3
 3035 despite some comic sparks , welcome to collinwood never catches fire . 1
 3036 even more baffling is that it 's funny . 2
 3037 an old-fashioned but emotionally stirring adventure tale of the kind they rarely make anymore . 3
 3038 not many movies have that kind of impact on me these_days . 4
 3039 there 's a spontaneity to the chateau , a sense of light-heartedness , that makes it attractive throughout . 3
 3040 a very capable nailbiter . 3
 3041 it 's not just a feel-good movie , it 's a feel movie . 3
 3042 the sound of gunfire and cell phones ringing . 2
 3043 but one thing 's for sure : it never comes close to being either funny or scary . 0
 3044 soderbergh seems capable only of delivering artfully lighted , earnest inquiries that lack the kind of genuine depth that would make them redeemable . 2
 3045 it has more in common with a fireworks display than a movie , which normally is expected to have characters and a storyline . 1
 3046 co-writer\/director jonathan parker 's attempts to fashion a brazil-like , hyper-real satire fall dreadfully short . 0
 3047 novak contemplates a heartland so overwhelmed by its lack of purpose that it seeks excitement in manufactured high drama . 1
 3048 blue_crush is so prolonged and boring it is n't even close to being the barn-burningly bad movie it promised it would be . 1
 3049 viewers will need all the luck they can muster just figuring out who 's who in this pretentious mess . 0
 3050 like an afterschool special with costumes by gianni versace , mad love looks better than it feels . 1
 3051 the basic premise is intriguing but quickly becomes distasteful and downright creepy . 1
 3052 the mystery of enigma is how a rich historical subject , combined with so much first-rate talent ... could have yielded such a flat , plodding picture . 1
 3053 it could have_been something special , but two things drag it down to mediocrity -- director clare peploe 's misunderstanding of marivaux 's rhythms , and mira sorvino 's limitations as a classical actress . 0
 3054 steadfastly uncinematic but powerfully dramatic . 3
 3055 at once emotional and richly analytical , the cosby-seinfeld encounter alone confirms the serious weight behind this superficially loose , larky documentary . 2
 3056 a summary of the plot does_n't quite do justice to the awfulness of the movie , for that comes through all too painfully in the execution . 0
 3057 big_fat liar is little more than home alone raised to a new , self-deprecating level . 0
 3058 young everlyn sampi , as the courageous molly craig , simply radiates star-power potential in this remarkable and memorable film . 4
 3059 ... the story simply putters along looking for astute observations and coming up blank . 1
 3060 it is also beautifully acted . 4
 3061 incoherence reigns . 1
 3062 the wanton slipperiness of \* corpus and its amiable jerking and reshaping of physical time and space would make it a great piece to watch with kids and use to introduce video as art . 4
 3063 77 minutes of pokemon may not last 4ever , it just seems like it does . 1
 3064 a joyous occasion 4
 3065 more precious than perspicacious 3
 3066 -lrb- t -rrb- he script is n't up to the level of the direction , nor are the uneven performances by the cast members , who seem bound and determined to duplicate bela lugosi 's now-cliched vampire accent . 1
 3067 its cast full of caffeinated comedy performances more than make up for its logical loopholes , which fly by so fast there 's no time to think about them anyway . 3
 3068 a sluggish pace and lack of genuine narrative hem the movie in every bit as much as life hems in the spirits of these young women . 1
 3069 the chateau has one very funny joke and a few other decent ones , but all it amounts to is a mildly funny , sometimes tedious , ultimately insignificant film . 1
 3070 this harrowing journey into combat hell vividly captures the chaotic insanity and personal tragedies that are all too abundant when human hatred spews forth unchecked . 2
 3071 while holm is terrific as both men and hjejle quite appealing , the film fails to make the most out of the intriguing premise . 2
 3072 that rare documentary that incorporates so much of human experience -- drama , conflict , tears and surprise -- that it transcends the normal divisions between fiction and nonfiction film . 4
 3073 a refreshing change from the usual whoopee-cushion effort aimed at the youth market . 4
 3074 a compelling motion_picture that illustrates an american tragedy . 4
 3075 at once disarmingly straightforward and strikingly devious . 4
 3076 much like its easily dismissive take on the upscale lifestyle , there is n't much there here . 0
 3077 robin williams departs from his fun friendly demeanor in exchange for a darker unnerving role . 2
 3078 this may be the first cartoon ever to look as if it were being shown on the projection television screen of a sports bar . 1
 3079 for a film that celebrates radical , nonconformist values , what to do in case of fire ? 2
 3080 the film grows on you . 3
 3081 imperfect ? 1
 3082 allegiance to chekhov , which director michael cacoyannis displays with somber earnestness in the new adaptation of the cherry orchard , is a particularly vexing handicap . 1
 3083 on that score , the film certainly does_n't disappoint . 4
 3084 angela gheorghiu as famous prima donna floria tosca , roberto alagna as her lover mario cavaradossi , and ruggero as the villainous , lecherous police chief scarpia , all sing beautifully and act adequately . 3
 3085 has a customarily jovial air but a deficit of flim-flam inventiveness . 1
 3086 fessenden continues to do interesting work , and it would be nice to see what he could make with a decent budget . 3
 3087 elegant , mannered and teasing . 3
 3088 foster and whitaker are especially fine . 4
 3089 i do_n't blame eddie_murphy but should n't owen wilson know a movie must have a story and a script ? 0
 3090 it 's a boring movie about a boring man , made watchable by a bravura performance from a consummate actor incapable of being boring . 3
 3091 ... a gleefully grungy , hilariously wicked black comedy ... 4
 3092 ... manages to deliver a fair bit of vampire fun . 3
 3093 nothing wrong with performances here , but the whiney characters bugged me . 1
 3094 this kind of hands-on storytelling is ultimately what makes shanghai ghetto move beyond a good , dry , reliable textbook and what allows it to rank with its worthy predecessors . 3
 3095 if villainous vampires are your cup of blood , blade 2 is definitely a cut above the rest . 3
 3096 it provides a grim , upsetting glimpse at the lives of some of the 1.2 million palestinians who live in the crowded cities and refugee camps of gaza . 2
 3097 still , the updated dickensian sensibility of writer craig bartlett 's story is appealing . 3
 3098 you 'd have to be a most hard-hearted person not to be moved by this drama . 3
 3099 the re - enactments , however fascinating they may be as history , are too crude to serve the work especially well . 1
 3100 it also shows how deeply_felt emotions can draw people together across the walls that might otherwise separate them . 3
 3101 the entire movie has a truncated feeling , but what 's available is lovely and lovable . 2
 3102 it 's also curious to note that this film , like the similarly ill-timed antitrust , is easily as bad at a fraction the budget . 0
 3103 shows moments of promise but ultimately succumbs to cliches and pat storytelling . 1
 3104 it might be ` easier ' to watch on video at home , but that should n't stop die-hard french film connoisseurs from going out and enjoying the big-screen experience . 3
 3105 with its paint fights , motorized scooter chases and dewy-eyed sentiment 2
 3106 enticing and often funny documentary . 4
 3107 though its story is only surface deep , the visuals and enveloping sounds of blue_crush make this surprisingly decent flick worth a summertime look-see . 3
 3108 here 's my advice , kev . 2
 3109 like all of egoyan 's work , ararat is fiercely intelligent and uncommonly ambitious . 3
 3110 the 3-d vistas from orbit , with the space station suspended like a huge set of wind chimes over the great blue globe , are stanzas of breathtaking , awe-inspiring visual poetry . 4
 3111 turns a potentially interesting idea into an excruciating film school experience that plays better only for the film 's publicists or for people who take as many drugs as the film 's characters 0
 3112 arliss howard 's ambitious , moving , and adventurous directorial_debut , big bad love , meets so many of the challenges it poses for itself that one can forgive the film its flaws . 4
 3113 but , no , we get another scene , and then another . 2
 3114 seagal ran out of movies years_ago , and this is just the proof . 0
 3115 there is no substitute for on-screen chemistry , and when friel pulls the strings that make williams sink into melancholia , the reaction in williams is as visceral as a gut punch . 4
 3116 -lrb- javier bardem is -rrb- one of the few reasons to watch the film , which director gerardo vera has drenched in swoony music and fever-pitched melodrama . 2
 3117 occasionally interesting but essentially unpersuasive , a footnote to a still evolving story . 2
 3118 the script ? 1
 3119 no cliche escapes the perfervid treatment of gang warfare called ces wild . 1
 3120 the movie is so resolutely cobbled together out of older movies that it even uses a totally unnecessary prologue , just because it seems obligatory . 0
 3121 a few hours after you 've_seen it , you forget you 've been to the movies . 1
 3122 ... with the gifted pearce on hand to keep things on semi-stable ground dramatically , this retooled machine is ultimately effective enough at achieving the modest , crowd-pleasing goals it sets for itself . 4
 3123 oh , james ! 3
 3124 the picture seems uncertain whether it wants to be an acidic all-male all about eve or a lush , swooning melodrama in the intermezzo strain . 1
 3125 the cast is phenomenal , especially the women . 4
 3126 the movie is our story as much as it is schmidt 's , no_matter if it 's viewed as a self-reflection or cautionary_tale . 2
 3127 the movie weighs no more than a glass of flat champagne . 1
 3128 too silly to take seriously . 1
 3129 it is also a testament to the integrity and vision of the band . 3
 3130 frequent flurries of creative belly laughs and genuinely enthusiastic performances ... keep the movie slaloming through its hackneyed elements with enjoyable ease . 3
 3131 it 's also not smart or barbed enough for older viewers -- not everyone thinks poo-poo jokes are ` edgy . ' 0
 3132 there are many definitions of ` time waster ' but this movie must surely be one of them . 0
 3133 once she lets her love depraved leads meet , -lrb- denis ' -rrb- story becomes a hopeless , unsatisfying muddle 0
 3134 it 's like an all-star salute to disney 's cheesy commercialism . 1
 3135 gooding is the energetic frontman , and it 's hard to resist his enthusiasm , even if the filmmakers come up with nothing original in the way of slapstick sequences . 3
 3136 the path ice_age follows most closely , though , is the one established by warner bros. giant chuck jones , who died a matter of weeks before the movie 's release . 2
 3137 it 's sweet and fluffy at the time , but it may leave you feeling a little sticky and unsatisfied . 1
 3138 with few respites , marshall keeps the energy humming , and his edits , unlike those in moulin rouge , are crisp and purposeful without overdoing it . 4
 3139 ... is there a deeper , more direct connection between these women , one that spans time and reveals meaning ? 2
 3140 the most ingenious film comedy since being john malkovich . 4
 3141 the setting turns out to be more interesting than any of the character dramas , which never reach satisfying conclusions . 1
 3142 an engrossing portrait of uncompromising artists trying to create something original against the backdrop of a corporate music industry that only seems to care_about the bottom line . 3
 3143 a smart and funny , albeit sometimes superficial , cautionary_tale of a technology in search of an artist . 3
 3144 -lrb- fiji diver rusi vulakoro and the married couple howard and michelle hall -rrb- show us the world they love and make us love it , too . 4
 3145 this would-be ` james_bond for the extreme generation ' pic is one big , dumb action movie . 0
 3146 we have an actor who is great fun to watch performing in a film that is only mildly diverting . 2

 3151 exciting documentary . 4
 3152 as comedic spotlights go , notorious c.h.o. hits all the verbal marks it should . 3
 3153 blade_ii is as estrogen-free as movies get , so you might want to leave your date behind for this one , or she 's gonna make you feel like you owe her big-time . 2
 3154 what makes the movie work -- to an admittedly limited extent -- is the commitment of two genuinely engaging performers . 2
 3155 and neither do cliches , no_matter how ` inside ' they are . 1
 3156 in its own way 2
 3157 the movie is virtually without context -- journalistic or historical . 0
 3158 if it 's not entirely memorable , the movie is certainly easy to watch . 3
 3159 an odd , haphazard , and inconsequential romantic_comedy . 1
 3160 too much of nemesis has a tired , talky feel . 1
 3161 how many more times will indie filmmakers subject us to boring , self-important stories of how horrible we are to ourselves and each_other ? 1
 3162 while the transgressive trappings -lrb- especially the frank sex scenes -rrb- ensure that the film is never dull , rodrigues 's beast-within metaphor is ultimately rather silly and overwrought , making the ambiguous ending seem goofy rather_than provocative . 1
 3163 an awkward hybrid of genres that just does_n't work . 1
 3164 beautifully crafted and brutally honest , promises offers an unexpected window into the complexities of the middle east struggle and into the humanity of its people . 4
 3165 in auteil 's less dramatic but equally incisive performance , he 's a charismatic charmer likely to seduce and conquer . 3
 3166 marvelously entertaining and deliriously joyous documentary . 4
 3167 it 's a square , sentimental drama that satisfies , as comfort food often can . 3
 3168 if sinise 's character had a brain his ordeal would be over in five minutes but instead the plot goes out of its way to introduce obstacles for him to stumble over . 2
 3169 sluggish , tonally uneven . 0
 3170 the film affords us intriguing glimpses of the insights gleaned from a lifetime of spiritual inquiry , but ram dass : fierce grace does_n't organize it with any particular insight . 2
 3171 the story is a rather simplistic one : grief drives her , love drives him , and a second chance to find love in the most unlikely place - it struck a chord in me . 3
 3172 a bit of a downer and a little over-dramatic at_times , but this is a beautiful film for people who like their romances to have that french realism . 3
 3173 a big meal of cliches that the talented cast generally chokes on . 1
 3174 entertaining enough , but nothing new 1
 3175 beautifully shot , delicately scored and powered by a set of heartfelt performances , it 's a lyrical endeavour . 4
 3176 hartley adds enough quirky and satirical touches in the screenplay to keep the film entertaining . 4
 3177 something for everyone . 3
 3178 the problem is that for the most part , the film is deadly dull . 0
 3179 a fine , rousing , g-rated family film , aimed mainly at little kids but with plenty of entertainment value to keep grown-ups from squirming in their seats . 4
 3180 fifty years after the fact , the world 's political situation seems little different , and -lrb- director phillip -rrb- noyce brings out the allegory with remarkable skill . 4
 3181 australian filmmaker david flatman uses the huge-screen format to make an old-fashioned nature film that educates viewers with words and pictures while entertaining them . 4
 3182 thoroughly engrossing and ultimately tragic . 1
 3183 ... a spoof comedy that carries its share of laughs -- sometimes a chuckle , sometimes a guffaw and , to my great pleasure , the occasional belly laugh . 4
 3184 has all the complexity and realistic human behavior of an episode of general hospital . 1
 3185 eight_legged_freaks is clever and funny , is amused by its special_effects , and leaves you feeling like you 've_seen a movie instead of an endless trailer . 3
 3186 sitting through the last reel -lrb- spoiler alert ! -rrb- 2
 3187 a small gem from belgium . 4
 3188 hugh_grant , who has a good line in charm , has never been more charming than in about a boy . 4
 3189 in addition to sporting one of the worst titles in recent cinematic history , ballistic : ecks vs. sever also features terrible , banal dialogue ; convenient , hole-ridden plotting ; superficial characters and a rather dull , unimaginative car chase . 0
 3190 for proof of that on the cinematic front , look no further than this 20th anniversary edition of the film that spielberg calls , retrospectively , his most personal work yet . 3
 3191 carrying this wafer-thin movie on his nimble shoulders , chan wades through putrid writing , direction and timing with a smile that says , ` if i stay positive , maybe i can channel one of my greatest pictures , drunken master . ' 1
 3192 skins has a desolate air , but eyre , a native american raised by white parents , manages to infuse the rocky path to sibling reconciliation with flashes of warmth and gentle humor . 3

 3197 an incredibly thoughtful , deeply meditative picture that neatly and effectively captures the debilitating grief felt in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks . 3
 3198 a jaw-droppingly beautiful work 4

 3206 -lrb- `` safe conduct '' -rrb- is a long movie at 163 minutes but it fills the time with drama , romance , tragedy , bravery , political intrigue , partisans and sabotage . 3
 3207 not bad , but not all that good . 2
 3208 expands the limits of what a film can be , taking us into the lives of women to whom we might not give a second look if we passed them on the street . 3

 3211 the campy results make mel brooks ' borscht belt schtick look sophisticated . 3
 3212 clint eastwood 's blood work is a lot like a well-made pb & j sandwich : familiar , fairly uneventful and boasting no real surprises -- but still quite tasty and inviting all the same . 3
 3213 bravado kathy ! 3
 3214 about_schmidt is undoubtedly one of the finest films of the year . 4
 3215 a powerful , chilling , and affecting study of one man 's dying fall . 4
 3216 there is no denying the power of polanski 's film ... 3
 3217 except for paymer as the boss who ultimately expresses empathy for bartleby 's pain , the performances are so stylized as to be drained of human emotion . 2
 3218 absolutely not . 1
 3219 the film is an earnest try at beachcombing verismo , but it would be even more indistinct than it is were it not for the striking , quietly vulnerable personality of ms. ambrose . 1
 3220 the movie , like bartleby , is something of a stiff -- an extra-dry office comedy that seems twice as long as its 83 minutes . 1
 3221 in the end , though , it is only mildly amusing when it could have_been so much more . 2
 3222 it 's a very tasteful rock and roll movie . 3
 3223 spielberg has managed to marry science fiction with film noir and action flicks with philosophical inquiry . 3
 3224 although what time offers tsai 's usual style and themes , it has a more colorful , more playful tone than his other films . 4
 3225 it 's a diverting enough hour-and-a-half for the family audience . 3
 3226 high_crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government \/ marine\/legal mystery , and that 's because the movie serves up all of that stuff , nearly subliminally , as the old-hat province of male intrigue . 1
 3227 anybody who enjoys quirky , fun , popcorn movies with a touch of silliness and a little bloodshed . 3
 3228 a waste of fearless purity in the acting craft . 1
 3229 the ethos of the chelsea hotel may shape hawke 's artistic aspirations , but he has n't yet coordinated his own dv poetry with the beat he hears in his soul . 1
 3230 with a tighter editorial process and firmer direction this material could work , especially since the actresses in the lead roles are all more than competent , but as is , personal velocity seems to be idling in neutral . 1
 3231 a bold -lrb- and lovely -rrb- experiment that will almost certainly bore most audiences into their own brightly colored dreams . 3
 3232 as spent screen series go , star trek : nemesis is even more suggestive of a 65th class reunion mixer where only eight surviving members show up -- and there 's nothing to drink . 2
 3233 not a bad premise , but the execution is lackluster at best . 2
 3234 ... the same tired old gags , modernized for the extreme sports generation . 2
 3235 abderrahmane sissako 's heremakono -lrb- waiting for happiness -rrb- is an elegiac portrait of a transit city on the west african coast struggling against foreign influences . 2
 3236 there are far worse messages to teach a young audience , which will_probably be perfectly happy with the sloppy slapstick comedy . 2
 3237 it may sound like a mere disease-of - the-week tv movie , but a song for martin is made infinitely more wrenching by the performances of real-life spouses seldahl and wollter . 2
 3238 resurrection has the dubious distinction of being a really bad imitation of the really bad blair_witch project . 1

 3245 with or without ballast tanks , k-19 sinks to a harrison ford low . 1
 3246 -lrb- screenwriter -rrb- pimental took the farrelly brothers comedy and feminized it , but it is a rather poor imitation . 2
 3247 a surprisingly sweet and gentle comedy . 3
 3248 while kids will_probably eat the whole_thing up , most adults will be way ahead of the plot . 2
 3249 predictable and cloying , though brown_sugar is so earnest in its yearning for the days before rap went nihilistic that it summons more spirit and bite than your average formulaic romantic quadrangle . 3
 3250 it 's about individual moments of mood , and an aimlessness that 's actually sort of amazing . 4
 3251 hollywood 's answer to an air ball . 2
 3252 it 's a smart , solid , kinetically-charged spy flick worthy of a couple hours of summertime and a bucket of popcorn . 4
 3253 a sensitive , cultivated treatment of greene 's work as well as a remarkably faithful one . 4
 3254 a stylish thriller . 4
 3255 for those who pride themselves on sophisticated , discerning taste , this might not seem like the proper cup of tea , however it is almost guaranteed that even the stuffiest cinema goers will laugh their \*\*\* off for an hour-and-a-half . 4

 3257 but the movie that does_n't really deliver for country music fans or for family audiences 0
 3258 alternates between deadpan comedy and heartbreaking loneliness and is n't afraid to provoke introspection in both its characters and its audience . 3
 3259 unfolds in a low-key , organic way that encourages you to accept it as life and go with its flow . 3
 3260 brown 's saga , like many before his , makes for snappy prose but a stumblebum of a movie . 2
 3261 a perfectly competent and often imaginative film that lacks what little lilo & stitch had in spades -- charisma . 2
 3262 the one-liners are snappy , the situations volatile and the comic opportunities richly rewarded . 4
 3263 this is a picture that maik , the firebrand turned savvy ad man , would be envious of : it hijacks the heat of revolution and turns it into a sales tool . 2
 3264 the charm of the first movie is still there , and the story feels like the logical , unforced continuation of the careers of a pair of spy kids . 3
 3265 whatever about warning kids about the dangers of ouija boards , someone should dispense the same advice to film directors . 2
 3266 -lrb- siegel -rrb- and co-writers lisa bazadona and grace woodard have relied too much on convention in creating the characters who surround frankie . 1

 3272 there are moments of hilarity to be had . 3
 3273 one problem with the movie , directed by joel schumacher , is that it jams too_many prefabricated story elements into the running_time . 1
 3274 it 's one long bore . 1
 3275 in spite of featuring a script credited to no fewer than five writers , apparently nobody here bothered to check it twice . 1
 3276 the scriptwriters are no less a menace to society than the film 's characters . 1
 3277 like mike is a slight and uninventive movie : like the exalted michael jordan referred to in the title , many can aspire but none can equal . 1
 3278 the most wondrous love story in years , it is a great film . 4
 3279 a prison comedy that never really busts out of its comfy little cell . 1
 3280 writer-director randall wallace has bitten off more than he or anyone else could chew , and his movie veers like a drunken driver through heavy traffic . 1
 3281 contrived as this may sound , mr. rose 's updating works surprisingly well . 3
 3282 if it were any more of a turkey , it would gobble in dolby digital stereo . 0
 3283 a culture-clash comedy that , in addition to being very funny , captures some of the discomfort and embarrassment of being a bumbling american in europe . 3
 3284 even_if it is generally amusing from time to time , i spy has all the same problems the majority of action comedies have . 1
 3285 what the audience feels is exhaustion , from watching a movie that is dark -lrb- dark green , to be exact -rrb- , sour , bloody and mean . 1
 3286 on a cutting room floor somewhere lies ... footage that might have made no_such_thing a trenchant , ironic cultural satire instead of a frustrating misfire . 0
 3287 colorful and deceptively buoyant until it suddenly pulls the rug out from under you , burkinabe filmmaker dani kouyate 's reworking of a folk story whose roots go back to 7th-century oral traditions is also a pointed political allegory . 2
 3288 arteta directs one of the best ensemble casts of the year 4
 3289 nothing happens , and it happens to flat characters . 1
 3290 lee 's achievement extends to his supple understanding of the role that brown played in american culture as an athlete , a movie star , and an image of black indomitability . 3
 3291 this rush to profits has created a predictably efficient piece of business notable largely for its overwhelming creepiness , for an eagerness to create images you wish you had n't seen , which , in this day and age , is of course the point . 3
 3292 it is an unstinting look_at a collaboration between damaged people that may or may not qual 3
 3293 the milieu is wholly unconvincing ... and the histrionics reach a truly annoying pitch . 1
 3294 every potential twist is telegraphed well in advance , every performance respectably muted ; the movie itself seems to have_been made under the influence of rohypnol . 2
 3295 ` men in black ii creates a new threat for the mib , but recycles the same premise . 2
 3296 a bracing , unblinking work that serves as a painful elegy and sobering cautionary_tale . 3
 3297 pacino is the best he 's been in years and keener is marvelous . 4
 3298 an awkwardly garish showcase that diverges from anything remotely probing or penetrating . 0
 3299 his work with actors is particularly impressive . 4
 3300 ... while dark water is n't a complete wash -lrb- no pun intended -rrb- , watched side-by-side with ringu , it ultimately comes_off as a pale successor . 1
 3301 ... bibbidy-bobbidi-bland . 0
 3302 it 's light on the chills and heavy on the atmospheric weirdness , and there are moments of jaw-droppingly odd behavior -- yet i found it weirdly appealing . 3
 3303 they kept much of the plot but jettisoned the stuff that would make this a moving experience for people who have n't read the book . 1
 3304 oh , and more entertaining , too . 3
 3305 this little film is so slovenly done , so primitive in technique , that it ca_n't really be called animation . 0
 3306 the film never_rises above a conventional , two dimension tale 1
 3307 the audience when i_saw this one was chuckling at all the wrong times , and that 's a bad sign when they 're supposed to be having a collective heart attack . 1
 3308 this is historical filmmaking without the balm of right-thinking ideology , either liberal or conservative . 3
 3309 sayles is making a statement about the inability of dreams and aspirations to carry forward into the next generation . 2
 3310 extremely bad . 0
 3311 the somber pacing and lack of dramatic fireworks make green dragon seem more like medicine than entertainment . 0
 3312 handsome and sophisticated approach to the workplace romantic_comedy . 3
 3313 a moving and solidly entertaining comedy\/drama that should bolster director and co-writer 4
 3314 more of a career curio than a major work . 2
 3315 a rude black comedy about the catalytic effect a holy fool has upon those around him in the cutthroat world of children 's television . 1
 3316 it 's obvious -lrb- je-gyu is -rrb- trying for poetry ; what he gets instead has all the lyricism of a limerick scrawled in a public restroom . 2
 3317 the movie 's ultimate point -- that everyone should be themselves -- is trite , but the screenwriter and director michel gondry restate it to the point of ridiculousness . 0
 3318 ringu is a disaster of a story , full of holes and completely lacking in chills . 0
 3319 hopelessly inane , humorless and under-inspired . 0
 3320 a high-spirited buddy movie about the reunion of berlin anarchists who face arrest 15 years after their crime . 3
 3321 the thing about guys like evans is this : you 're never_quite sure where self-promotion ends and the truth begins . 1
 3322 they were right . 2
 3323 a huge disappointment coming , as it does , from filmmakers and performers of this calibre 0
 3324 a banal , virulently unpleasant excuse for a romantic_comedy . 0
 3325 humorless , self-conscious art drivel , made without a glimmer of intelligence or invention . 0
 3326 it 's rare that a movie can be as intelligent as this one is in every regard except its storyline ; everything that 's good is ultimately scuttled by a plot that 's just too boring and obvious . 1
 3327 peralta 's mythmaking could have used some informed , adult hindsight . 2
 3328 meyjes 's movie , like max rothman 's future , does not work . 1
 3329 all comedy is subversive , but this unrelenting bleak insistence on opting out of any opportunity for finding meaning in relationships or work just becomes sad . 0
 3330 technically and artistically inept . 1
 3331 an average b-movie with no aspirations to be anything more . 1
 3332 if_you ever wanted to be an astronaut , this is the ultimate movie experience - it 's informative and breathtakingly spectacular . 4
 3333 it 's a loathsome movie , it really is and it makes absolutely no sense . 0
 3334 the movie 's captivating details are all in the performances , from foreman 's barking-mad taylor to thewlis 's smoothly sinister freddie and bettany\/mcdowell 's hard-eyed gangster . 4
 3335 this is mild-mannered , been-there material given a pedestrian spin by a director who needed a touch of the flamboyant , the outrageous . 2
 3336 smart and taut . 4
 3337 matters play out realistically if not always fairly . 3
 3338 giggling at the absurdities and inconsistencies is part of the fun . 3
 3339 hope keeps arising that the movie will live up to the apparent skills of its makers and the talents of its actors , but it does_n't . 2
 3340 symbolically , warm water under a red bridge is a celebration of feminine energy , a tribute to the power of women to heal . 3
 3341 it uses some of the figures from the real-life story to portray themselves in the film . 3
 3342 what might have_been readily dismissed as the tiresome rant of an aging filmmaker still thumbing his nose at convention takes a surprising , subtle turn at the midway point . 1
 3343 cusack 's just brilliant in this . 4
 3344 it 's an odd show , pregnant with moods , stillborn except as a harsh conceptual exercise . 1
 3345 a dark-as-pitch comedy that frequently veers into corny sentimentality , probably would not improve much after a therapeutic zap of shock treatment . 1
 3346 even the digressions are funny . 3
 3347 this submarine drama earns the right to be favorably compared to das boot . 3
 3348 what 's so fun about this silly , outrageous , ingenious thriller is the director 's talent . 4
 3349 ... the cast portrays their cartoon counterparts well ... but quite frankly , scoob and shag do_n't eat enough during the film . ' 1
 3350 there is a subversive element to this disney cartoon , providing unexpected fizzability . 3
 3351 i know we 're not supposed to take it seriously , but i ca_n't shake the thought that undercover brother missed an opportunity to strongly present some profound social commentary . 2
 3352 as a good old-fashioned adventure for kids , spirit : stallion of the cimarron is a winner . 3
 3353 even_if you_'re an elvis person , you wo_n't find anything to get excited about on this dvd . 0
 3354 a journey spanning nearly three decades of bittersweet camaraderie and history , in which we feel that we truly know what makes holly and marina tick , and our hearts go out to them as both continue to negotiate their imperfect , love-hate relationship . 3
 3355 lacks the spirit of the previous two , and makes all those jokes about hos and even more unmentionable subjects seem like mere splashing around in the muck . 0
 3356 the work of an artist tormented by his heritage , using his storytelling ability to honor the many faceless victims . 3
 3357 resident evil is n't a product of its cinematic predecessors so much as an mtv , sugar hysteria , and playstation cocktail . 1
 3358 too stagey , talky -- and long -- for its own good . 1
 3359 the gorgeously elaborate continuation of `` the lord of the rings '' trilogy is so huge that a column of words can not adequately describe co-writer\/director peter jackson 's expanded vision of j.r.r. tolkien 's middle-earth . 4
 3360 no thanks . 1
 3361 this off-putting french romantic_comedy 1
 3362 it 's never laugh-out-loud funny , but it is frequently amusing . 3
 3363 amari has dressed up this little parable in a fairly irresistible package full of privileged moments and memorable performances . 4
 3364 as banal as the telling may be -- and at_times , all my loved ones more than flirts with kitsch -- the tale commands attention . 3
 3365 an acceptable way to pass a little over an hour with moviegoers ages 8-10 , but it 's unlikely to inspire anything more than a visit to mcdonald 's , let alone some savvy street activism . 1
 3366 the thing just never gets off the ground . 0
 3367 who is this movie for ? 2
 3368 i 've never seen or heard anything quite like this film , and i recommend it for its originality alone . 4
 3369 it 's a feel-good movie about which you can actually feel good . 4
 3370 one of the best inside-show-biz yarns ever . 4
 3371 there must be an audience that enjoys the friday series , but i would n't be interested in knowing any of them personally . 0
 3372 formula 51 has dulled your senses faster and deeper than any recreational drug on the market . 2
 3373 is `` ballistic '' worth the price of admission ? 2
 3374 mctiernan 's remake may be lighter on its feet -- the sober-minded original was as graceful as a tap-dancing rhino -- but it is just as boring and as obvious . 1
 3375 gives us a lot to chew on , but not all of it has been properly digested . 2
 3376 klein , charming in comedies like american pie and dead-on in election , delivers one of the saddest action hero performances ever witnessed . 1
 3377 brainy , artistic and muted , almost to the point of suffocation . 2
 3378 the self-serious equilibrium makes its point too well ; a movie , like life , is n't much fun without the highs and lows . 1
 3379 equlibrium could pass for a thirteen-year-old 's book report on the totalitarian themes of 1984 and farenheit 451 . 1
 3380 and it 's harder still to believe that anyone in his right mind would want to see the it . 0
 3381 loud , silly , stupid and pointless . 0
 3382 calculated swill . 2
 3383 merely -lrb- and literally -rrb- tosses around sex toys and offers half-hearted paeans to empowerment that are repeatedly undercut by the brutality of the jokes , most at women 's expense . 0
 3384 jackson shamefully strolls through this mess with a smug grin , inexplicably wearing a kilt and carrying a bag of golf clubs over one shoulder . 1
 3385 unspeakable , of course , barely begins to describe the plot and its complications . 0
 3386 as the sulking , moody male hustler in the title role , -lrb- franco -rrb- has all of dean 's mannerisms and self-indulgence , but none of his sweetness and vulnerability . 1
 3387 driven by a fantastic dual performance from ian holm ... the film is funny , insightfully human and a delightful lark for history buffs . 4
 3388 while the film is not entirely successful , it still manages to string together enough charming moments to work . 3
 3389 but the problem with wendigo , for all its effective moments , is n't really one of resources . 1
 3390 if we 're to slap protagonist genevieve leplouff because she 's french , do we have that same option to slap her creators because they 're clueless and inept ? 0
 3391 this is an exercise in chilling style , and twohy films the sub , inside and out , with an eye on preserving a sense of mystery . 4
 3392 a sobering and powerful documentary about the most severe kind of personal loss : rejection by one 's mother . 3
 3393 contradicts everything we 've come to expect from movies nowadays . 3
 3394 by that measure , it is a failure . 0
 3395 feels like nothing quite so much as a middle-aged moviemaker 's attempt to surround himself with beautiful , half-naked women . 2
 3396 enjoyably fast-moving , hard-hitting documentary . 4
 3397 i_'m happy to have seen it -- not as an alternate version , but as the ultimate exercise in viewing deleted scenes . 2
 3398 if borstal boy is n't especially realistic , it is an engaging nostalgia piece . 2
 3399 stirs potentially enticing ingredients into an uneasy blend of ghost and close encounters of the third kind . 2
 3400 i loved this film . 4
 3401 weirdly , broomfield has compelling new material but he does_n't unveil it until the end , after endless scenes of him wheedling reluctant witnesses and pointing his camera through the smeared windshield of his rental car . 1
 3402 like the tuck family themselves , this movie just goes on and on and on and on 0
 3403 once one experiences mr. haneke 's own sadistic tendencies toward his audience , one is left with a sour taste in one 's mouth , and little else . 0
 3404 nettelbeck has crafted an engaging fantasy of flavours and emotions , one part romance novel , one part recipe book . 3
 3405 return to never land is much more p.c. than the original version -lrb- no more racist portraits of indians , for instance -rrb- , but the excitement is missing . 1
 3406 ... manages to fall closer in quality to silence than to the abysmal hannibal . 2
 3407 the transporter bombards the viewer with so many explosions and side snap kicks that it ends_up being surprisingly dull . 1
 3408 -lrb- janey -rrb- forgets about her other obligations , leading to a tragedy which is somehow guessable from the first few minutes , maybe because it echoes the by now intolerable morbidity of so many recent movies . 1
 3409 he 's just a sad aristocrat in tattered finery , and the film seems as deflated as he does . 1
 3410 reign of fire is hardly the most original fantasy film ever_made -- beyond road warrior , it owes enormous debts to aliens and every previous dragon drama -- but that barely makes it any less entertaining . 3
 3411 one just waits grimly for the next shock without developing much attachment to the characters . 2
 3412 while the story does seem pretty unbelievable at_times , it 's awfully entertaining to watch . 3
 3413 90 punitive minutes of eardrum-dicing gunplay , screeching-metal smashups , and flaccid odd-couple sniping . 0
 3414 pleasant but not more than recycled jock piffle . 1
 3415 despite the surface attractions -- conrad l. hall 's cinematography will likely be nominated for an oscar next year -- there 's something impressive and yet lacking about everything . 3
 3416 by its modest , straight-ahead standards , undisputed scores a direct hit . 3
 3417 the most compelling performance of the year adds substantial depth to this shocking testament to anti-semitism and neo-fascism . 4
 3418 it 's clear why deuces_wild , which was shot two years_ago , has been gathering dust on mgm 's shelf . 1
 3419 teens only . 2
 3420 if the full_monty was a freshman fluke , lucky break is -lrb- cattaneo -rrb- sophomore slump . 1
 3421 hard-core slasher aficionados will find things to like ... but overall the halloween series has lost its edge . 1
 3422 derailed by bad writing and possibly also by some of that extensive post-production reworking to aim the film at young males in the throes of their first full flush of testosterone . 0
 3423 i_liked it just enough . 3
 3424 garcia and the other actors help make the wobbly premise work . 3
 3425 gloriously straight from the vagina . 2
 3426 the only entertainment you_'ll derive from this choppy and sloppy affair will be from unintentional giggles -- several of them . 0
 3427 a movie that sends you out of the theater feeling like you 've actually spent time living in another community . 3
 3428 ... a story , an old and scary one , about the monsters we make , and the vengeance they take . 2
 3429 it has a dashing and resourceful hero ; a lisping , reptilian villain ; big fights ; big hair ; lavish period scenery ; and a story just complicated enough to let you bask in your own cleverness as you figure it out . 3
 3430 those 24-and-unders looking for their own caddyshack to adopt as a generational signpost may have to keep on looking . 1
 3431 there is n't one moment in the film that surprises or delights . 0
 3432 what a great way to spend 4 units of your day . 3
 3433 ... very funny , very enjoyable ... 4
 3434 despite the film 's shortcomings , the stories are quietly moving . 3
 3435 i do_n't think most of the people who loved the 1989 paradiso will prefer this new version . 1
 3436 whether or not you_'re enlightened by any of derrida 's lectures on `` the other '' and `` the self , '' derrida is an undeniably fascinating and playful fellow . 4
 3437 adam_sandler 's heart may be in the right place , but he needs to pull his head out of his butt 1

 3439 this amiable picture talks tough , but it 's all bluster -- in the end it 's as sweet as greenfingers ... 3
 3440 shows that jackie_chan is getting older , and that 's something i would rather live in denial about 1
 3441 there 's no point in extracting the bare bones of byatt 's plot for purposes of bland hollywood romance . 1
 3442 whenever you think you 've_seen the end of the movie , we cut to a new scene , which also appears to be the end . 1
 3443 the film occasionally tries the viewer 's patience with slow pacing and a main character who sometimes defies sympathy , but it ultimately satisfies with its moving story . 3
 3444 p.t. anderson understands the grandness of romance and how love is the great equalizer that can calm us of our daily ills and bring out joys in our lives that we never knew were possible . 4
 3445 absolutely -lrb- and unintentionally -rrb- terrifying . 2
 3446 like a grinning jack o ' lantern , its apparent glee is derived from a lobotomy , having had all its vital essence scooped out and discarded . 1
 3447 a movie that will thrill you , touch you and make you laugh as well . 3
 3448 george lucas returns as a visionary with a tale full of nuance and character dimension . 3
 3449 a sad and rote exercise in milking a played-out idea -- a straight guy has to dress up in drag -- that shockingly manages to be even worse than its title would imply . 1
 3450 one of the most depressing movie-going experiences i can think of is to sit_through about 90_minutes of a so-called ` comedy ' and not laugh once . 1
 3451 this remake of lina wertmuller 's 1975 eroti-comedy might just be the biggest husband-and-wife disaster since john and bo derek made the ridiculous bolero . 1
 3452 others , more attuned to the anarchist maxim that ` the urge to destroy is also a creative urge ' , or more willing to see with their own eyes , will find morrison 's iconoclastic uses of technology to be liberating . 4
 3453 norton is magnetic as graham . 3

 5270 the artwork is spectacular and unlike most animaton from japan , the characters move with grace and panache . 4
 5271 it strikes hardest ... when it reminds you how pertinent its dynamics remain . 3

 5275 hollywood_ending just is n't very funny . 1
 5276 the film may not hit as hard as some of the better drug-related pictures , but it still manages to get a few punches in . 2
 5277 before it collapses into exactly the kind of buddy cop comedy it set out to lampoon , anyway . 1
 5278 unlike lots of hollywood fluff , this has layered , well-developed characters and some surprises . 3
 5279 an unflinching look_at the world 's dispossessed . 2
 5280 ultimately ... the movie is too heady for children , and too preachy for adults . 1
 5281 but seriously , folks , it does_n't work . 1
 5282 too damn weird to pass up , and for the blacklight crowd , way cheaper -lrb- and better -rrb- than pink floyd tickets . 3
 5283 sweetly sexy , funny and touching . 4
 5284 it 's got some pretentious eye-rolling moments and it did_n't entirely grab me , but there 's stuff here to like . 2
 5285 a muddy psychological_thriller rife with miscalculations . 1
 5286 de_niro cries . 2
 5287 a domestic melodrama with weak dialogue and biopic cliches . 1

 5292 so aggressively cheery that pollyana would reach for a barf bag . 1
 5293 -lrb- t -rrb- he film is never sure to make a clear point -- even if it seeks to rely on an ambiguous presentation . 1
 5294 the cinematic equivalent of patronizing a bar favored by pretentious , untalented artistes who enjoy moaning about their cruel fate . 1
 5295 seems content to dog-paddle in the mediocre end of the pool , and it 's a sad , sick sight . 1
 5296 holland lets things peter out midway , but it 's notably better acted -- and far less crass - than some other recent efforts in the burgeoning genre of films about black urban professionals . 3
 5297 ... little more than a well-acted television melodrama shot for the big_screen . 2
 5298 with elements cribbed from lang 's metropolis , welles ' kane , and eisenstein 's potemkin 1
 5299 sometimes this ` blood ' seems as tired as its protagonist ... still , the pulse never disappears entirely , and the picture crosses the finish line winded but still game . 2
 5300 it 's been made with an innocent yet fervid conviction that our hollywood has all but lost . 2
 5301 though the aboriginal aspect lends the ending an extraordinary poignancy , and the story itself could be played out in any working class community in the nation . 3
 5302 a tour_de_force of modern cinema . 3
 5303 murder by numbers just does_n't add_up . 1

 5318 the film is hampered by its predictable plot and paper-thin supporting characters . 1
 5319 debut effort by `` project greenlight '' winner is sappy and amateurish . 1
 5320 it 's a familiar story , but one that is presented with great sympathy and intelligence . 3
 5321 sadly , full frontal plays_like the work of a dilettante . 1
 5322 it 's not exactly worth the bucks to expend the full price for a date , but when it comes out on video , it 's well worth a rental . 2
 5323 children , christian or otherwise , deserve to hear the full story of jonah 's despair -- in all its agonizing , catch-22 glory -- even if they spend years trying to comprehend it . 3
 5324 mazel tov to a film about a family 's joyous life acting on the yiddish stage . 4
 5325 unsurprisingly , the way this all works out makes the women look more like stereotypical caretakers and moral teachers , instead of serious athletes . 1
 5326 much smarter and more attentive than it first sets out to be . 3
 5327 a fascinating but choppy documentary . 2
 5328 this is a remake by the numbers , linking a halfwit plot to a series of standup routines in which wilson and murphy show how funny they could have_been in a more ambitious movie . 1
 5329 an enjoyable , if occasionally flawed , experiment . 3
 5330 i 'll go out on a limb . 3
 5331 just pile up . 2
 5332 a brutal and funny work . 4
 5333 if nothing_else , `` rollerball '' 2002 may go down in cinema history as the only movie ever in which the rest of the cast was outshined by ll cool j. 1
 5334 chilling in its objective portrait of dreary , lost twenty-first century america . 3
 5335 there 's no doubting that this is a highly ambitious and personal project for egoyan , but it 's also one that , next to his best work , feels clumsy and convoluted . 2
 5336 the sequel plays out like a flimsy excuse to give blade fans another look_at wesley snipes ' iconic hero doing battle with dozens of bad guys -- at once . 1
 5337 they should have found orson welles ' great-grandson . 2
 5338 it offers a glimpse of the solomonic decision facing jewish parents in those turbulent times : to save their children and yet to lose them . 3
 5339 he 's a better actor than a standup comedian . 3
 5340 really does feel like a short stretched out to feature length . 1

 5343 the camera whirls ! 2
 5344 this new zealand coming-of-age movie is n't really about anything . 1
 5345 what makes the movie special is its utter sincerity . 3
 5346 -lrb- a -rrb- devastatingly powerful and astonishingly vivid holocaust drama . 4
 5347 a distinctly mixed bag , the occasional bursts of sharp writing alternating with lots of sloppiness and the obligatory moments of sentimental ooze . 1
 5348 flat , misguided comedy . 1
 5349 with minimal imagination , you could restage the whole_thing in your bathtub . 1
 5350 i_'m sorry to say that this should seal the deal - arnold is not , nor will he be , back . 1
 5351 the script boasts some tart tv-insider humor , but the film has not a trace of humanity or empathy . 1
 5352 it is definitely worth_seeing . 4
 5353 director roger kumble offers just enough sweet and traditional romantic_comedy to counter the crudity . 3
 5354 the problem with the mayhem in formula 51 is not that it 's offensive , but that it 's boring . 1
 5355 although it starts off so bad that you feel like running out screaming , it eventually works its way up to merely bad rather_than painfully awful . 1
 5356 a worthy idea , but the uninspired scripts , acting and direction never rise above the level of an after-school tv special . 1
 5357 this is absolutely and completely ridiculous and an insult to every family whose mother has suffered through the horrible pains of a death by cancer . 0
 5358 instead of a balanced film that explains the zeitgeist that is the x games , we get a cinematic postcard that 's superficial and unrealized . 0
 5359 the adventure does_n't contain half the excitement of balto , or quarter the fun of toy story 2 . 1
 5360 anemic chronicle of money grubbing new yorkers and their serial loveless hook ups . 2

 5364 in all the annals of the movies , few films have_been this odd , inexplicable and unpleasant . 0
 5365 argento , at only 26 , brings a youthful , out-to-change-the-world aggressiveness to the project , as if she 's cut open a vein and bled the raw film stock . 3
 5366 elaborate special_effects take centre screen , so that the human story is pushed to one side . 3
 5367 the film has the courage of its convictions and excellent performances on its side . 4
 5368 ... its stupidities wind up sticking in one 's mind a lot more than the cool bits . 2
 5369 audiences are advised to sit near the back and squint to avoid noticing some truly egregious lip-non-synching , but otherwise the production is suitably elegant . 3
 5370 this rough trade punch-and-judy act did_n't play well then and it plays worse now . 2
 5371 whether our action-and-popcorn obsessed culture will embrace this engaging and literate psychodrama is n't much of a mystery , unfortunately . 2
 5372 a quasi-documentary by french filmmaker karim dridi that celebrates the hardy spirit of cuban music . 3
 5373 the only question ... is to determine how well the schmaltz is manufactured -- to assess the quality of the manipulative engineering . 1
 5374 solaris is rigid and evasive in ways that soderbergh 's best films , `` erin brockovich , '' `` out of sight '' and `` ocean 's eleven , '' never were . 4
 5375 it 's likely that whatever you thought of the first production -- pro or con -- you_'ll likely think of this one . 2
 5376 ... familiar and predictable , and 4\/5ths of it might as well have come from a xerox machine rather_than -lrb- writer-director -rrb- franc . 1
 5377 a movie just for friday fans , critics be damned . 3
 5378 if_you come from a family that eats , meddles , argues , laughs , kibbitzes and fights together , then go see this delightful comedy . 3
 5379 laconic and very stilted in its dialogue , this indie flick never found its audience , probably because it 's extremely hard to relate to any of the characters . 1
 5380 the movie does such an excellent job of critiquing itself at every faltering half-step of its development that criticizing feels more like commiserating . 1
 5381 ... a solid , unassuming drama . 3
 5382 much of this slick and sprightly cgi feature is sufficiently funny to amuse even the most resolutely unreligious parents who escort their little ones to megaplex screenings . 3
 5383 no big hairy deal . 2
 5384 the package in which this fascinating -- and timely -- content comes wrapped is disappointingly generic . 1
 5385 sparse but oddly compelling . 3
 5386 for most of its footage , the new thriller proves that director m. night shyamalan can weave an eerie spell and that mel gibson can gasp , shudder and even tremble without losing his machismo . 4
 5387 it 's mildly interesting to ponder the peculiar american style of justice that plays out here , but it 's so muddled and derivative that few will bother thinking it all through . 1
 5388 feardotcom 's thrills are all cheap , but they mostly work . 2
 5389 you try to guess the order in which the kids in the house will be gored . 1
 5390 that the film opens with maggots crawling on a dead dog is not an out of place metaphor . 1
 5391 not really a thriller so much as a movie for teens to laugh , groan and hiss at . 1
 5392 forget about one oscar nomination for julianne moore this year - she should get all five . 4
 5393 the boys ' sparring , like the succession of blows dumped on guei , wears down the story 's more cerebral , and likable , plot elements . 2
 5394 at its most basic , this cartoon adventure is that wind-in-the-hair exhilarating . 3
 5395 simone is not a bad film . 3
 5396 graphic sex may be what 's attracting audiences to unfaithful , but gripping performances by lane and gere are what will keep them awake . 4
 5397 the members manage to pronounce kok exactly as you think they might , thus giving the cast ample opportunity to use that term as often as possible . 2
 5398 there may have_been a good film in `` trouble_every_day , '' but it is not what is on the screen . 1
 5399 full frontal had no effect and elicited no sympathies for any of the characters . 1
 5400 ... a bland murder-on-campus yawner . 0
 5401 the only problem is that , by the end , no one in the audience or the film seems to really care . 0

 5413 `` mr. deeds '' is suitable summer entertainment that offers escapism without requiring a great_deal of thought . 3
 5414 just about the best straight-up , old-school horror film of the last 15 years . 4
 5415 the verdict : two bodies and hardly a laugh between them . 1
 5416 -lrb- d -rrb- espite its familiar subject_matter , ice_age is consistently amusing and engrossing ... 3

 5418 schaeffer is n't in this film , which may be why it works as well as it does . 3
 5419 your children will be occupied for 72 minutes . 3
 5420 this hastily mounted production exists only to capitalize on hopkins ' inclination to play hannibal lecter again , even though harris has no immediate inclination to provide a fourth book . 0
 5421 a pint-sized ` goodfellas ' designed to appeal to the younger set , it 's not a very good movie in any objective sense , but it does mostly hold one 's interest . 2
 5422 this documentary is a dazzling , remarkably unpretentious reminder of what -lrb- evans -rrb- had , lost , and got back . 4
 5423 as earnest as a community-college advertisement , american chai is enough to make you put away the guitar , sell the amp , and apply to medical school . 1
 5424 a thoroughly enjoyable , heartfelt coming-of-age comedy . 3

 5426 an unintentional parody of every teen movie made in the last five years . 2

 5430 alternately hilarious and sad , aggravating and soulful , scathing and joyous . 3
 5431 the year 2002 has conjured up more coming-of-age stories than seem possible , but take care of my cat emerges as the very best of them . 4
 5432 it briefly flirts with player masochism , but the point of real interest - -- audience sadism -- is evaded completely . 2
 5433 the best film of the year 2002 . 3
 5434 a moving and not infrequently breathtaking film . 4
 5435 an ambitious ` what if ? ' 3
 5436 a slam-bang extravaganza that is all about a wild-and-woolly , wall-to-wall good time . 4
 5437 overstylized 1
 5438 vulgar is too optimistic a title . 0
 5439 campanella 's competent direction and his excellent cast overcome the obstacles of a predictable outcome and a screenplay that glosses over rafael 's evolution . 3
 5440 a refreshingly realistic , affectation-free coming-of-age_tale . 4
 5441 what 's needed so badly but what is virtually absent here is either a saving dark humor or the feel of poetic tragedy . 1
 5442 left me with the visceral sensation of longing , lasting traces of charlotte 's web of desire and desperation . 3
 5443 `` the kid stays in the picture '' is a great story , terrifically told by the man who wrote it but this cliff notes edition is a cheat . 2
 5444 you can almost see mendes and company getting together before a single frame had been shot and collectively vowing , ` this is going to be something really good . ' 3
 5445 the screenwriters dig themselves in deeper every time they toss logic and science into what is essentially a `` dungeons and dragons '' fantasy with modern military weaponry ... 1
 5446 a fascinating examination of the joyous , turbulent self-discovery made by a proper , middle-aged woman . 3
 5447 its use of the thriller form to examine the labyrinthine ways in which people 's lives cross and change , buffeted by events seemingly out of their control , is intriguing , provocative stuff . 4
 5448 visually exciting sci-fi film which suffers_from a lackluster screenplay . 2
 5449 a sterling film - a cross between boys do_n't cry , deliverance , and ode to billy joe - lies somewhere in the story of matthew shepard , but that film is yet to be made . 2
 5450 narc can only remind us of brilliant crime dramas without becoming one itself . 2
 5451 the actors improvise and scream their way around this movie directionless , lacking any of the rollicking dark humor so necessary to make this kind of idea work on screen . 0
 5452 kapur weighs down the tale with bogus profundities . 1
 5453 provides a porthole into that noble , trembling incoherence that defines us all . 2
 5454 one of the greatest films i 've ever_seen . 4
 5455 by_turns numbingly dull-witted and disquietingly creepy . 1
 5456 poignant and moving , a walk to remember is an inspirational love story , capturing the innocence and idealism of that first encounter . 4
 5457 while the production details are lavish , film has little insight_into the historical period and its artists , particularly in how sand developed a notorious reputation . 1
 5458 it 's not life-affirming -- its vulgar and mean , but i_liked it . 2
 5459 ` anyone with a passion for cinema , and indeed sex , should see it as soon as possible . ' 4
 5460 to call this one an eventual cult classic would be an understatement , and woe is the horror fan who opts to overlook this goofily endearing and well-lensed gorefest . 4
 5461 sorority boys , which is as bad at it is cruel , takes every potential laugh and stiletto-stomps the life out of it . 0
 5462 adaptation is simply brilliant . 4
 5463 i enjoyed the movie in a superficial way , while never sure what its purpose was . 3
 5464 the sight of the name bruce willis brings to mind images of a violent battlefield action picture , but the film has a lot more on its mind -- maybe too much . 2
 5465 it will make you think twice about what might be going on inside each trailer park you drive past -- even if it chiefly inspires you to drive a little faster . 3
 5466 eight_legged_freaks falls flat as a spoof . 1
 5467 while it can be a bit repetitive , overall it 's an entertaining and informative documentary . 3
 5468 ultimately , `` mib ii '' succeeds due to its rapid-fire delivery and enough inspired levity that it ca_n't be dismissed as mindless . 3
 5469 j. lo will earn her share of the holiday box office pie , although this movie makes one thing perfectly clear : she 's a pretty woman , but she 's no working girl . 3
 5470 some writer dude , i think his name was , uh , michael zaidan , was supposed to have like written the screenplay or something , but , dude , the only thing that i ever saw that was written down were the zeroes on my paycheck . 0
 5471 but this is not a movie about an inhuman monster ; it 's about a very human one . 2
 5472 there 's a persistent theatrical sentiment and a woozy quality to the manner of the storytelling , which undercuts the devastatingly telling impact of utter loss personified in the film 's simple title . 1
 5473 splendidly illustrates the ability of the human spirit to overcome adversity . 3
 5474 the filmmakers know how to please the eye , but it is not always the prettiest pictures that tell the best story . 3
 5475 a fine film , but it would be a lot better if it stuck to betty fisher and left out the other stories . 2
 5476 but not a whit more . 2
 5477 it 's not a great monster movie . 1
 5478 might best be enjoyed as a daytime soaper . 2
 5479 a drama of great power , yet some members of the audience will leave the theater believing they have seen a comedy . 2
 5480 though tom shadyac 's film kicks off spookily enough , around the halfway mark it takes an abrupt turn into glucose sentimentality and laughable contrivance . 1
 5481 a must-see for fans of thoughtful war films and those interested in the sights and sounds of battle . 4
 5482 an enthralling aesthetic experience , one that 's steeped in mystery and a ravishing , baroque beauty . 4

 5486 despite all the closed-door hanky-panky , the film is essentially juiceless . 0
 5487 american musical comedy as we know it would n't exist without the precedent of yiddish theater , whose jolly , fun-for-fun 's - sake communal spirit goes to the essence of broadway . 3

 5503 for all the complications , it 's all surprisingly predictable . 2
 5504 michael moore has perfected the art of highly entertaining , self-aggrandizing , politically motivated documentary-making , and he 's got as potent a topic as ever here . 3
 5505 sometimes entertaining , sometimes indulgent -- but never less than pure wankery . 2

 5525 it 's sort of in-between , and it works . 3
 5526 impeccably filmed , sexually charged , but ultimately lacking in substance , not to mention dragged down by a leaden closing act . 2

 6596 i am more offended by his lack of faith in his audience than by anything on display here . 1

 6600 grown-up quibbles are beside the point here . 2
 6601 although purportedly a study in modern alienation , it 's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s\/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out . 1
 6602 a piece of mildly entertaining , inoffensive fluff that drifts aimlessly for 90_minutes before lodging in the cracks of that ever-growing category : unembarrassing but unmemorable . 1
 6603 its vision of that awkward age when sex threatens to overwhelm everything_else is acute enough to make everyone who has been there squirm with recognition . 2

 6613 trapped presents a frightening and compelling ` what if ? ' 3
 6614 none of his actors stand out , but that 's less of a problem here than it would be in another film : characterization matters less than atmosphere . 2
 6615 you have once_again entered the bizarre realm where director adrian lyne holds sway , where all relationships are simultaneously broadly metaphorical , oddly abstract , and excruciatingly literal . 2

 6617 a film of quiet power . 3
 6618 changing lanes is an anomaly for a hollywood movie ; it 's a well-written and occasionally challenging social drama that actually has something interesting to say . 4

 6636 almost everyone growing up believes their family must look like `` the addams family '' to everyone looking in ... `` my_big_fat_greek wedding '' comes from the heart ... 3

 6644 for all the charm of kevin kline and a story that puts old-fashioned values under the microscope , there 's something creepy about this movie . 3
 6645 mckay shows crushingly little curiosity about , or is ill-equipped to examine , the interior lives of the characters in his film , much less incorporate them into his narrative . 0

 6651 made to be jaglomized is the cannes film festival , the annual riviera spree of flesh , buzz , blab and money . 1
 6652 at once a testament to the divine calling of education and a demonstration of the painstaking process of imparting knowledge . 3
 6653 plays_like one long , meandering sketch inspired by the works of john waters and todd solondz , rather_than a fully developed story . 1
 6654 an unholy mess , driven by the pathetic idea that if you shoot something on crummy-looking videotape , it must be labelled ` hip ' , ` innovative ' and ` realistic ' . 0
 6655 wo_n't be placed in the pantheon of the best of the swashbucklers but it is a whole_lot of fun and you get to see the one of the world 's best actors , daniel auteuil , have a whale of a good time . 4
 6656 the video work is so grainy and rough , so dependent on being ` naturalistic ' rather_than carefully lit and set up , that it 's exhausting to watch . 2

 6681 bravo for history rewritten , and for the uncompromising knowledge that the highest power of all is the power of love . 3
 6682 it 's also built on a faulty premise , one it follows into melodrama and silliness . 1

 6697 apparently writer-director attal thought he need only cast himself and his movie-star wife sitting around in their drawers to justify a film . 2
 6698 a jumbled fantasy comedy that did not figure out a coherent game plan at scripting , shooting or post-production stages . 1
 6699 neither as scary-funny as tremors nor demented-funny as starship troopers , the movie is n't tough to take as long as you 've paid a matinee price . 1

 6702 it wo_n't hold up over the long haul , but in the moment , finch 's tale provides the forgettable pleasures of a saturday matinee . 3
 6703 it 's the type of stunt the academy loves : a powerful political message stuffed into an otherwise mediocre film . 2
 6704 much of the movie 's charm lies in the utter cuteness of stuart and margolo . 3
 6705 both garcia and jagger turn in perfectly executed and wonderfully sympathetic characters , who are alternately touching and funny . 3
 6706 watching junk like this induces a kind of abstract guilt , as if you were paying dues for good books unread , fine music never heard . 1
 6707 the film just might turn on many people to opera , in general , an art form at once visceral and spiritual , wonderfully vulgar and sublimely lofty -- and as emotionally grand as life . 4

 6716 even though the film does_n't manage to hit all of its marks , it 's still entertaining to watch the target practice . 3
 6717 a film that will be best appreciated by those willing to endure its extremely languorous rhythms , waiting for happiness is ultimately thoughtful without having much dramatic impact . 3

 6719 a creaky staircase gothic . 2
 6720 `` white oleander , '' the movie , is akin to a reader 's digest condensed version of the source material . 1
 6721 this dreadfully earnest inversion of the concubine love triangle eschews the previous film 's historical panorama and roiling pathos for bug-eyed mugging and gay-niche condescension . 1

 6737 this engrossing , characteristically complex tom clancy thriller is shifty in the manner in which it addresses current terrorism anxieties and sidesteps them at the same time . 2
 6738 a suffocating rape-payback horror show that hinges on the subgenre 's most enabling victim ... and an ebullient affection for industrial-model meat freezers . 3
 6739 with ` bowling for columbine , ' michael moore gives us the perfect starting point for a national conversation about guns , violence , and fear . 4
 6740 the script feels as if it started to explore the obvious voyeuristic potential of ` hypertime ' but then backed off when the producers saw the grosses for spy_kids . 2
 6741 the name says it all . 2

 6745 shows holmes has the screen presence to become a major-league leading lady , -lrb- but -rrb- the movie itself is an underachiever , a psychological mystery that takes its sweet time building to a climax that 's scarcely a surprise by the time it arrives . 1

 6753 a distinctly minor effort that will be seen to better advantage on cable , especially considering its barely feature-length running_time of one hour . 1
 6754 rosenthal -lrb- halloween ii -rrb- seems to have forgotten everything he ever knew about generating suspense . 1
 6755 the acting is fine but the script is about as interesting as a recording of conversations at the wal-mart checkout line . 1

 7887 the doofus-on - the-loose banter of welcome to collinwood has a cocky , after-hours loopiness to it . 2
 7888 the comedy is nonexistent . 0
 7889 the first bond movie in ages that is n't fake fun . 3
 7890 a wretched movie that reduces the second world_war to one man 's quest to find an old flame . 1
 7891 death to smoochy is often very funny , but what 's even more remarkable is the integrity of devito 's misanthropic vision . 3
 7892 armed with a game supporting cast , from the pitch-perfect forster to the always hilarious meara and levy , like mike shoots and scores , doing its namesake proud . 4
 7893 claire is a terrific role for someone like judd , who really ought to be playing villains . 3
 7894 too bad kramer could n't make a guest appearance to liven things up . 1
 7895 if hill is n't quite his generation 's don siegel -lrb- or robert aldrich -rrb- , it 's because there 's no discernible feeling beneath the chest hair ; 1
 7896 but you 'd never guess that from the performances . 2
 7897 cannon 's confidence and laid-back good spirits are , with the drumming routines , among the film 's saving graces . 3
 7898 the movie is hardly a masterpiece , but it does mark ms. bullock 's best work in some time . 3
 7899 the film becomes an overwhelming pleasure , and you find yourself rooting for gai 's character to avoid the fate that has befallen every other carmen before her . 3
 7900 nearly all the fundamentals you take for granted in most films are mishandled here . 1
 7901 -lrb- clooney 's -rrb- debut can be accused of being a bit undisciplined , but it has a tremendous , offbeat sense of style and humor that suggests he was influenced by some of the filmmakers who have directed him , especially the coen brothers and steven_soderbergh . 3
 7902 the pitch must have read like a discarded house beautiful spread . 2
 7903 go . 2
 7904 for free . 2
 7905 bring tissues . 3
 7906 the piano teacher is not an easy film . 1
 7907 by the time you reach the finale , you_'re likely wondering why you 've been watching all this strutting and posturing . 0
 7908 lawrence should stick to his day job . 1
 7909 sparkles in its deft portrait of tinseltown 's seasoned veterans of gossip , wealth , paranoia , and celebrityhood . 2
 7910 sex with strangers will shock many with its unblinking frankness . 2
 7911 plays_like a checklist of everything rob reiner and his cast were sending up . 2
 7912 this movie has the usual impossible stunts ... but it has just as many scenes that are lean and tough enough to fit in any modern action movie . 3
 7913 as if drop dead gorgeous was n't enough , this equally derisive clunker is fixated on the spectacle of small-town competition . 1
 7914 it 's a drag how nettelbeck sees working women -- or at_least this working woman -- for whom she shows little understanding . 0
 7915 such a bad movie that its luckiest viewers will be seated next to one of those ignorant pinheads who talk throughout the show . 0
 7916 promises is one film that 's truly deserving of its oscar nomination . 4
 7917 `` 13 conversations '' holds its goodwill close , but is relatively slow to come to the point . 2
 7918 some good , organic character work , lots of obvious political insights and 3
 7919 such a wildly uneven hit-and-miss enterprise , you ca_n't_help suspecting that it was improvised on a day-to-day basis during production . 1
 7920 the stars may be college kids , but the subject_matter is as adult as you can get : the temptations of the flesh are unleashed by a slightly crazed , overtly determined young_woman and a one-night swim turns into an ocean of trouble . 3
 7921 , `` they 're out there ! '' 3
 7922 in the end , there is n't much to it . 0
 7923 it makes me feel weird \/ thinking about all the bad things in the world \/ like puppies with broken legs \/ and butterflies that die \/ and movies starring pop queens 1
 7924 collapses after 30 minutes into a slap-happy series of adolescent violence . 0
 7925 what starts off as a satisfying kids flck becomes increasingly implausible as it races through contrived plot points . 1
 7926 it 's absolutely amazing how first-time director kevin donovan managed to find something new to add to the canon of chan . 3
 7927 really quite funny . 4
 7928 prepare to marvel again . 3
 7929 it 's definitely an improvement on the first blade , since it does_n't take itself so deadly seriously . 3
 7930 but mostly it 's a work that , with humor , warmth , and intelligence , captures a life interestingly lived . 4
 7931 brash , intelligent and erotically perplexing , haneke 's portrait of an upper class austrian society and the suppression of its tucked away demons is uniquely felt with a sardonic jolt . 4
 7932 succeeds as a well-made evocation of a subculture . 3
 7933 it may not be history -- but then again , what if it is ? 2
 7934 a backstage must-see for true fans of comedy . 4
 7935 allen 's funniest and most likeable movie in years . 4
 7936 medem may have disrobed most of the cast , leaving their bodies exposed , but the plot remains as guarded as a virgin with a chastity belt . 1
 7937 well-meaning but inert . 2
 7938 an inconsequential , barely there bit of piffle . 1
 7939 do you chuckle at the thought of an ancient librarian whacking a certain part of a man 's body ? 2
 7940 how good this film might be , depends if you believe that the shocking conclusion is too much of a plunge or not . 3
 7941 for something as splendid-looking as this particular film , the viewer expects something special but instead gets -lrb- sci-fi -rrb- rehash . 1
 7942 with dirty deeds , david caesar has stepped into the mainstream of filmmaking with an assurance worthy of international acclaim and with every cinematic tool well under his control -- driven by a natural sense for what works on screen . 4
 7943 but the talented cast alone will keep you watching , as will the fight scenes . 4
 7944 if we sometimes need comforting fantasies about mental illness , we also need movies like tim mccann 's revolution no. 9 . 3
 7945 one of the finest , most humane and important holocaust movies ever_made . 4
 7946 cage makes an unusual but pleasantly haunting debut behind the camera . 3
 7947 ... flat-out amusing , sometimes endearing and often fabulous , with a solid cast , noteworthy characters , delicious dialogue and a wide supply of effective sight gags . 3
 7948 two tedious acts light on great scares and a good surprise ending . 3
 7949 japanese director shohei imamura 's latest film is an odd but ultimately satisfying blend of the sophomoric and the sublime . 3
 7950 it 's a treat watching shaw , a british stage icon , melting under the heat of phocion 's attentions . 3
 7951 rifkin no_doubt fancies himself something of a hubert selby jr. , but there is n't an ounce of honest poetry in his entire script ; it 's simply crude and unrelentingly exploitative . 0
 7952 a chilly , remote , emotionally distant piece ... so dull that its tagline should be : ` in space , no one can hear you snore . ' 0
 7953 just offbeat enough to keep you interested without coming close to bowling you over . 3
 7954 unofficially , national lampoon 's van wilder is son of animal house . 2
 7955 lurid and less than lucid work . 1
 7956 deuces_wild treads heavily into romeo and juliet\/west side story territory , where it plainly has no business going . 1
 7957 the isolated moments of creative insanity finally are lost in the thin soup of canned humor . 2
 7958 hollywood_ending is not show-stoppingly hilarious , but scathingly witty nonetheless . 3
 7959 if there 's a heaven for bad movies , deuces_wild is on its way . 0
 7960 call this the full_monty on ice , the underdog sports team formula redux . 2
 7961 ever see one of those comedies that just seem like a bad idea from frame one ? 1
 7962 despite its sincere acting , signs is just another unoriginal run of the mill sci-fi film with a flimsy ending and lots of hype . 1
 7963 a manically generous christmas vaudeville . 3
 7964 it 's as if allen , at 66 , has stopped challenging himself . 1
 7965 mendes still does_n't quite know how to fill a frame . 1
 7966 some movies were made for the big_screen , some for the small screen , and some , like ballistic : ecks vs. sever , were made for the palm screen . 1
 7967 while the filmmaking may be a bit disjointed , the subject_matter is so fascinating that you wo_n't care . 3
 7968 still , not every low-budget movie must be quirky or bleak , and a happy ending is no cinematic sin . 2
 7969 the movie is a desperate miscalculation . 0
 7970 the film does_n't sustain its initial promise with a jarring , new-agey tone creeping into the second half 1
 7971 it irritates and saddens me that martin lawrence 's latest vehicle can explode obnoxiously into 2,500 screens while something of bubba ho-tep 's clearly evident quality may end up languishing on a shelf somewhere . 1
 7972 if reno is to the left of liberal on the political spectrum , her tough , funny , rather chaotic show is n't subversive so much as it is nit-picky about the hypocrisies of our time . 2
 7973 a tedious parable about honesty and good sportsmanship . 2
 7974 draggin ' about dragons 2
 7975 pap invested in undergraduate doubling subtexts and ridiculous stabs at existentialism reminding of the discovery of the wizard of god in the fifth trek flick . 1
 7976 kinnear and dafoe give what may be the performances of their careers . 4
 7977 it 's difficult to feel anything much while watching this movie , beyond mild disturbance or detached pleasure at the acting . 1
 7978 like being able to hit on a 15-year old when you_'re over 100 . 1
 7979 the thought of watching this film with an audience full of teenagers fixating on its body humour and reinforcement of stereotypes -lrb- of which they 'll get plenty -rrb- fills me with revulsion . 0
 7980 there 's not a fresh idea at the core of this tale . 1
 7981 it was only a matter of time before some savvy producer saw the potential success inherent in the mixture of bullock bubble and hugh goo . 3
 7982 but mr. polanski creates images even more haunting than those in mr. spielberg 's 1993 classic . 4
 7983 a mimetic approximation of better films 1
 7984 the closest thing to the experience of space travel 3
 7985 this would have_been better than the fiction it has concocted , and there still could have_been room for the war scenes . 1
 7986 director charles stone iii applies more detail to the film 's music than to the story line ; what 's best about drumline is its energy . 4
 7987 if_you can read the subtitles -lrb- the opera is sung in italian -rrb- and you like ` masterpiece theatre ' type costumes , you_'ll enjoy this movie . 3
 7988 `` frailty '' starts out like a typical bible killer story , but it turns out to be significantly different -lrb- and better -rrb- than most films with this theme . 4
 7989 diane lane works nothing short of a minor miracle in unfaithful . 4
 7990 a mix of gritty realism , crisp storytelling and radiant compassion that effortlessly draws you in . 4
 7991 if_you love reading and\/or poetry , then by all means check it out . 3
 7992 did it move me to care_about what happened in 1915 armenia ? 2
 7993 a highly watchable , giggly little story with a sweet edge to it . 3
 7994 quelle surprise ! 2
 7995 the film 's trailer also looked like crap , so crap is what i was expecting . 0
 7996 the biggest_problem with this movie is that it 's not nearly long enough . 2
 7997 the movie , while beautiful , feels labored , with a hint of the writing exercise about it . 2
 7998 unexpected , and often contradictory , truths emerge . 3
 7999 one of the best of a growing strain of daring films ... that argue that any sexual relationship that does_n't hurt anyone and works for its participants is a relationship that is worthy of our respect . 3
 8000 a film with a great premise but only a great premise . 3
 8001 one of those so-so films that could have_been much better . 1
 8002 normally , rohmer 's talky films fascinate me , but when he moves his setting to the past , and relies on a historical text , he loses the richness of characterization that makes his films so memorable . 1
 8003 circuit queens wo_n't learn a thing , they 'll be too busy cursing the film 's strategically placed white sheets . 2
 8004 labute 's careful handling makes the material seem genuine rather_than pandering . 4
 8005 tom green and an ivy league college should never appear together on a marquee , especially when the payoff is an unschooled comedy like stealing_harvard , which fails to keep 80 minutes from seeming like 800 . 2
 8006 the great pity is that those responsible did_n't cut their losses -- and ours -- and retitle it the adventures of direct-to-video nash , and send it to its proper home . 1
 8007 a film that begins with the everyday lives of naval personnel in san diego and ends with scenes so true and heartbreaking that tears welled up in my eyes both times i_saw the film . 4
 8008 there 's a little violence and lots of sex in a bid to hold our attention , but it grows monotonous after a while , as do joan and philip 's repetitive arguments , schemes and treachery . 1
 8009 made eddie_murphy a movie star and the man has n't aged a day . 3
 8010 even when he 's not at his most critically insightful , godard can still be smarter than any 50 other filmmakers still at work . 3
 8011 but , like silence , it 's a movie that gets under your skin . 1
 8012 wanker goths are on the loose ! 2
 8013 it sounds like another clever if pointless excursion into the abyss , and that 's more or less how it plays out . 1
 8014 a must for fans of british cinema , if only because so many titans of the industry are along for the ride . 4
 8015 it 's a fine , focused piece of work that reopens an interesting controversy and never succumbs to sensationalism . 4
 8016 romantic comedy and dogme 95 filmmaking may seem odd bedfellows , but they turn out to be delightfully compatible here . 4
 8017 at a time when we 've learned the hard way just how complex international terrorism is , collateral damage paints an absurdly simplistic picture . 1
 8018 a fascinating documentary about the long and eventful spiritual journey of the guru who helped launch the new age . 4
 8019 rodriguez has the chops of a smart-aleck film school brat and the imagination of a big kid ... 3
 8020 the film 's lack of personality permeates all its aspects -- from the tv movie-esque , affected child acting to the dullest irish pub scenes ever filmed . 0
 8021 eight_legged_freaks wo_n't join the pantheon of great monster\/science fiction flicks that we have come to love ... 1
 8022 there is a beautiful , aching sadness to it all . 3
 8023 harry potter and the chamber of secrets is deja vu all over again , and while that is a cliche , nothing could be more appropriate . 2
 8024 the kind of primal storytelling that george lucas can only dream of . 3
 8025 the actors must indeed be good to recite some of this laughable dialogue with a straight face . 1
 8026 stress ` dumb . ' 1
 8027 in questioning the election process , payami graphically illustrates the problems of fledgling democracies , but also the strength and sense of freedom the iranian people already possess , with or without access to the ballot box . 3
 8028 while the film is competent , it 's also uninspired , lacking the real talent and wit to elevate it beyond its formula to the level of classic romantic_comedy to which it aspires . 1
 8029 it works well enough , since the thrills pop up frequently , and the dispatching of the cast is as often imaginative as it is gory . 3
 8030 the hard-to-predict and absolutely essential chemistry between the down-to-earth bullock and the nonchalant grant proves to be sensational , and everything meshes in this elegant entertainment . 4
 8031 norton holds the film together . 2
 8032 there 's not one decent performance from the cast and not one clever line of dialogue . 0
 8033 the film brilliantly shines on all the characters , as the direction is intelligently accomplished . 4
 8034 a delightful surprise because despite all the backstage drama , this is a movie that tells stories that work -- is charming , is moving , is funny and looks professional . 4
 8035 ... the maudlin way its story unfolds suggests a director fighting against the urge to sensationalize his material . 1
 8036 too_many scenarios in which the hero might have an opportunity to triumphantly sermonize , and too few that allow us to wonder for ourselves if things will turn out okay . 0
 8037 a flawed film but an admirable one that tries to immerse us in a world of artistic abandon and political madness and very nearly succeeds . 2
 8038 it would n't matter so much that this arrogant richard pryor wannabe 's routine is offensive , puerile and unimaginatively foul-mouthed if it was at_least funny . 1
 8039 the makers of mothman prophecies succeed in producing that most frightening of all movies -- a mediocre horror film too bad to be good and too good to be bad . 1
 8040 epps has neither the charisma nor the natural affability that has made tucker a star . 0
 8041 given the fact that virtually no one is bound to show up at theatres for it , the project should have_been made for the tube . 0
 8042 i am not generally a huge fan of cartoons derived from tv shows , but hey arnold ! 3
 8043 this is a fascinating film because there is no clear-cut hero and no all-out villain . 4
 8044 rehearsals are frequently more fascinating than the results . 3
 8045 the dark and bittersweet twist feels strange as things turn nasty and tragic during the final third of the film . 2
 8046 the film thrusts the inchoate but already eldritch christian right propaganda machine into national media circles . 2
 8047 the engagingly primitive animated special_effects contribute to a mood that 's sustained through the surprisingly somber conclusion . 3
 8048 hip-hop prison thriller of stupefying absurdity . 1
 8049 is a question for philosophers , not filmmakers ; all the filmmakers need to do is engage an audience . 1
 8050 if_you enjoy being rewarded by a script that assumes you are n't very bright , then blood work is for you . 0
 8051 nair does_n't treat the issues lightly . 3
 8052 by and large this is mr. kilmer 's movie , and it 's his strongest performance since the doors . 3
 8053 this masterfully calibrated psychological_thriller thrives on its taut performances and creepy atmosphere even if the screenplay falls somewhat short . 3
 8054 the charming result is festival in cannes . 3
 8055 `` home movie '' is the film equivalent of a lovingly rendered coffee table book . 2
 8056 cherry orchard is badly edited , often awkwardly directed and suffers_from the addition of a wholly unnecessary pre-credit sequence designed to give some of the characters a ` back story . ' 1
 8057 though excessively tiresome , the uncertainty principle , as verbally pretentious as the title may be , has its handful of redeeming features , as long as you discount its ability to bore . 2
 8058 so brisk is wang 's pacing that none of the excellent cast are given air to breathe . 2
 8059 the only time 8 crazy nights comes close to hitting a comedic or satirical target is during the offbeat musical numbers . 2
 8060 me without you has a bracing truth that 's refreshing after the phoniness of female-bonding pictures like divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood . 4
 8061 some of the most ravaging , gut-wrenching , frightening war scenes since `` saving private ryan '' have_been recreated by john woo in this little-known story of native americans and their role in the second great war . 3
 8062 ... a plotline that 's as lumpy as two-day old porridge ... the filmmakers ' paws , sad to say , were all over this `` un-bear-able '' project ! 0
 8063 the story has some nice twists but the ending and some of the back-story is a little tired . 1
 8064 there 's no excuse for following up a delightful , well-crafted family film with a computer-generated cold fish . 1
 8065 on top of a foundering performance , -lrb- madonna 's -rrb- denied her own athleticism by lighting that emphasizes every line and sag . 1
 8066 shiner can certainly go the distance , but is n't world championship material 3
 8067 the film is bright and flashy in all the right ways . 4
 8068 if anything , see it for karen black , who camps up a storm as a fringe feminist conspiracy theorist named dirty dick . 3
 8069 the aaa of action , xxx is a blast of adrenalin , rated eee for excitement . 4
 8070 what remains is a variant of the nincompoop benigni persona , here a more annoying , though less angry version of the irresponsible sandlerian manchild , undercut by the voice of the star of road trip . 0
 8071 a well-done film of a self-reflexive , philosophical nature . 4
 8072 an old-fashioned scary movie , one that relies on lingering terror punctuated by sudden shocks and not constant bloodshed punctuated by flying guts . 3
 8073 although melodramatic and predictable , this romantic_comedy explores the friendship between five filipino-americans and their frantic efforts to find love . 2
 8074 nothing sticks , really , except a lingering creepiness one feels from being dragged through a sad , sordid universe of guns , drugs , avarice and damaged dreams . 0
 8075 brosnan gives a portrayal as solid and as perfect as his outstanding performance as bond in die another day . 4
 8076 goes a long way on hedonistic gusto . 2
 8077 thirteen conversations about one thing lays out a narrative puzzle that interweaves individual stories , and , like a mobius strip , elliptically loops back to where it began . 3
 8078 i_'m sure there 's a teenage boy out there somewhere who 's dying for this kind of entertainment . 1
 8079 the acting is just fine , but there 's not enough substance here to sustain interest for the full 90_minutes , especially with the weak payoff . 1
 8080 the first hour is tedious though ford and neeson capably hold our interest , but its just not a thrilling movie . 1
 8081 steven_soderbergh 's digital video experiment is a clever and cutting , quick and dirty look_at modern living and movie life . 3
 8082 weighted down with slow , uninvolving storytelling and flat acting . 0
 8083 sheridan had a wonderful account to work from , but , curiously , he waters it down , turning grit and vulnerability into light reading . 1
 8084 no_amount of arty theorizing -- the special_effects are ` german-expressionist , ' according to the press notes -- can render it anything but laughable . 0
 8085 what goes on for the 110 minutes of `` panic room '' is a battle of witlessness between a not-so-bright mother and daughter and an even less capable trio of criminals . 1
 8086 illiterate , often inert sci-fi action thriller . 1
 8087 when compared to the usual , more somber festival entries , davis ' highly personal brand of romantic_comedy is a tart , smart breath of fresh air that stands out from the pack even if the picture itself is somewhat problematic . 4
 8088 the best thing about the movie is its personable , amusing cast . 3
 8089 inherently caustic and oddly whimsical , the film chimes in on the grieving process and strangely draws the audience into the unexplainable pain and eccentricities that are attached to the concept of loss . 3
 8090 heaven is a haunting dramatization of a couple 's moral ascension . 2
 8091 haneke 's script -lrb- from elfriede jelinek 's novel -rrb- is contrived , unmotivated , and psychologically unpersuasive , with an inconclusive ending . 0
 8092 with an expressive face reminiscent of gong li and a vivid personality like zhang ziyi 's , dong stakes out the emotional heart of happy . 3
 8093 a modestly made but profoundly moving documentary . 4
 8094 fred schepisi 's tale of four englishmen facing the prospect of their own mortality views youthful affluence not as a lost ideal but a starting point . 3
 8095 it is , however , a completely honest , open-hearted film that should appeal to anyone willing to succumb to it . 4
 8096 movies like high_crimes flog the dead horse of surprise as if it were an obligation . 0
 8097 a zippy 96 minutes of mediocre special_effects , hoary dialogue , fluxing accents , and -- worst of all -- silly-looking morlocks . 1
 8098 the movie does_n't generate a lot of energy . 1
 8099 one of those decades-spanning historical epics that strives to be intimate and socially encompassing but fails to do justice to either effort in three_hours of screen time . 1
 8100 a captivatingly quirky hybrid of character portrait , romantic_comedy and beat-the-clock thriller . 3
 8101 the plot is plastered with one hollywood cliche after another , most of which involve precocious kids getting the better of obnoxious adults . 1
 8102 i like all four of the lead actors a lot and they manage to squeeze a few laughs out of the material , but they 're treading water at best in this forgettable effort . 3
 8103 loud , chaotic and largely unfunny . 0
 8104 abandon spends 90_minutes trying figure out whether or not some cocky pseudo-intellectual kid has intentionally left college or was killed . 1
 8105 the script is a disaster , with cloying messages and irksome characters . 1
 8106 the art demands live viewing . 3
 8107 since dahmer resorts to standard slasher flick thrills when it should be most in the mind of the killer , it misses a major opportunity to be truly revelatory about his psyche . 1
 8108 none of this sounds promising and , indeed , the first half of sorority boys is as appalling as any ` comedy ' to ever spill from a projector 's lens . 0
 8109 this mild-mannered farce , directed by one of its writers , john c. walsh , is corny in a way that bespeaks an expiration date passed a long time ago . 1
 8110 visually sumptuous but intellectually stultifying . 2
 8111 but that they are doing it is thought-provoking . 3
 8112 vera has created a provocative , absorbing drama that reveals the curse of a self-hatred instilled by rigid social mores . 3
 8113 it aimlessly and unsuccessfully attempts to fuse at_least three dull plots into one good one . 0
 8114 the film sounds like the stuff of lurid melodrama , but what makes it interesting as a character_study is the fact that the story is told from paul 's perspective . 3
 8115 a moving and weighty depiction of one family 's attempts to heal after the death of a child . 3
 8116 as i settled into my world_war_ii memories , i found myself strangely moved by even the corniest and most hackneyed contrivances . 3
 8117 this is amusing for about three minutes . 2
 8118 its strengths and weaknesses play off each_other virtually to a stand-off , with the unfortunate trump card being the dreary mid-section of the film . 2
 8119 as happily glib and vicious as its characters . 2
 8120 mr. caine and mr. fraser are the whole show here , with their memorable and resourceful performances . 4
 8121 it really is a shame that more wo_n't get an opportunity to embrace small , sweet ` evelyn . ' 3
 8122 the problem with the film is whether these ambitions , laudable in themselves , justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of auschwitz ii-birkenau . 1
 8123 too much of the movie feels contrived , as if the filmmakers were worried the story would n't work without all those gimmicks . 1
 8124 the picture runs a mere 84 minutes , but it 's no glance . 3
 8125 an elegant and sly deadpan comedy . 3
 8126 with its hint of an awkward hitchcockian theme in tact , harmon 's daunting narrative promotes a reasonable landscape of conflict and pathos to support the scattershot terrorizing tone 2
 8127 the notion of deleting emotion from people , even in an advanced prozac nation , is so insanely dysfunctional that the rampantly designed equilibrium becomes a concept doofus . 0
 8128 best enjoyed as a work of fiction inspired by real-life events . 3
 8129 mr. soderbergh 's direction and visual style struck me as unusually and unimpressively fussy and pretentious . 0
 8130 debate it . 2
 8131 a wildly entertaining scan of evans ' career . 4
 8132 like the full_monty , this is sure to raise audience 's spirits and leave them singing long after the credits roll . 4
 8133 but not without cheesy fun factor . 3
 8134 upsetting and thought-provoking , the film has an odd purity that does_n't bring you into the characters so much as it has you study them . 3
 8135 a live-action cartoon , a fast-moving and cheerfully simplistic 88 minutes of exaggerated action put together with the preteen boy in mind . 3
 8136 a dazzling thing to behold -- as long as you_'re wearing the somewhat cumbersome 3d goggles the theater provides . 3
 8137 could use a little more humanity , but it never lacks in eye-popping visuals . 3
 8138 mostly , shafer and co-writer gregory hinton lack a strong-minded viewpoint , or a sense of humor . 1
 8139 i_'m not sure these words have ever been together in the same sentence : this erotic cannibal movie is boring . 0
 8140 gambling and throwing a basketball game for money is n't a new plot -- in fact toback himself used it in black and white . 2
 8141 with an admirably dark first script by brent hanley , paxton , making his directorial feature debut , does strong , measured work . 4
 8142 bolstered by exceptional performances and a clear-eyed take on the economics of dealing and the pathology of ghetto fabulousness . 4
 8143 douglas mcgrath 's nicholas_nickleby does dickens as it should be done cinematically . 4
 8144 how i killed my father would be a rarity in hollywood . 2
 8145 the problem is not that it 's all derivative , because plenty of funny movies recycle old tropes . 2
 8146 that the e-graveyard holds as many good ideas as bad is the cold comfort that chin 's film serves up with style and empathy . 3
 8147 ends up offering nothing more than the latest schwarzenegger or stallone flick would . 1
 8148 the film 's only missteps come from the script 's insistence on providing deep emotional motivation for each and every one of abagnale 's antics . 2
 8149 at best this is a film for the under-7 crowd . 1
 8150 a thoughtful movie , a movie that is concerned with souls and risk and schemes and the consequences of one 's actions . 4
 8151 jaw-droppingly superficial , straining to get by on humor that is not even as daring as john ritter 's glory days on three 's company . 1
 8152 even through its flaws , revolution # 9 proves to be a compelling , interestingly told film . 3
 8153 it 's still adam_sandler , and it 's not little nicky . 2
 8154 sorvino is delightful in the central role . 3
 8155 bogs down badly as we absorb jia 's moody , bad-boy behavior which he portrays himself in a one-note performance . 2
 8156 an awful movie that will only satisfy the most emotionally malleable of filmgoers . 0
 8157 exhilarating but blatantly biased . 3
 8158 the story of trouble_every_day ... is so sketchy it amounts to little more than preliminary notes for a science-fiction horror film , and the movie 's fragmentary narrative style makes piecing the story together frustrating difficult . 0
 8159 lame sweet_home leaves no southern stereotype unturned . 1
 8160 first-time writer-director dylan kidd also has a good ear for dialogue , and the characters sound like real people . 3
 8161 it is very difficult to care_about the character , and that is the central flaw of the film . 0
 8162 what makes it worth watching is quaid 's performance . 3
 8163 by_turns pretentious , fascinating , ludicrous , provocative and vainglorious . 3
 8164 an empty , ugly exercise in druggy trance-noir and trumped-up street credibility . 2
 8165 especially give credit to affleck . 4
 8166 if_you grew up on scooby -- you_'ll love this movie . 3
 8167 it 's hard to imagine anyone managing to steal a movie not only from charismatic rising star jake gyllenhaal but also from accomplished oscar winners susan sarandon , dustin hoffman and holly hunter , yet newcomer ellen pompeo pulls off the feat with aplomb . 4
 8168 after you laugh once -lrb- maybe twice -rrb- , you will have completely forgotten the movie by the time you get back to your car in the parking lot . 0
 8169 the screenplay flounders under the weight of too_many story lines . 1
 8170 snipes is both a snore and utter tripe . 1
 8171 the troubling thing about clockstoppers is that it does_n't make any sense . 1
 8172 there 's no good answer to that one . 1
 8173 singer\/composer bryan adams contributes a slew of songs -- a few potential hits , a few more simply intrusive to the story -- but the whole package certainly captures the intended , er , spirit of the piece . 3
 8174 it 's a road-trip drama with too_many wrong turns . 0
 8175 seriously , rent the disney version . 1
 8176 you_'ll forget about it by monday , though , and if they 're old enough to have developed some taste , so will your kids . 0
 8177 like many such biographical melodramas , it suffers_from the awkwardness that results from adhering to the messiness of true stories . 0
 8178 no cute factor here ... not that i mind ugly ; the problem is he has no character , loveable or otherwise . 0
 8179 a remarkable movie with an unsatisfying ending , which is just the point . 3
 8180 if_you 're a fan of the series you_'ll love it and probably want to see it twice . 4
 8181 unless bob crane is someone of particular interest to you , this film 's impressive performances and adept direction are n't likely to leave a lasting impression . 1
 8182 it does_n't flinch from its unsettling prognosis , namely , that the legacy of war is a kind of perpetual pain . 1
 8183 if_you recognize zeus -lrb- the dog from snatch -rrb- it will make you wish you were at home watching that movie instead of in the theater watching this one . 1
 8184 ... a trashy little bit of fluff stuffed with enjoyable performances and a bewildering sense of self-importance 2
 8185 if_you 're really renting this you_'re not interested in discretion in your entertainment choices , you_'re interested in anne geddes , john grisham , and thomas kincaid . 2
 8186 like a can of 2-day old coke . 0
 8187 what jackson has done is proven that no amount of imagination , no creature , no fantasy story and no incredibly outlandish scenery 1
 8188 as a girl-meets-girl romantic_comedy , kissing jessica steinis quirky , charming and often hilarious . 4
 8189 humorous and heartfelt , douglas mcgrath 's version of ` nicholas_nickleby ' left me feeling refreshed and hopeful . 4
 8190 ... a solid , well-formed satire . 4
 8191 may offend viewers not amused by the sick sense of humor . 1
 8192 the lady and the duke is eric rohmer 's economical antidote to the bloated costume drama 2
 8193 assayas ' ambitious , sometimes beautiful adaptation of jacques chardonne 's novel . 3
 8194 it does_n't take a rocket scientist to figure out that this is a mormon family movie , and a sappy , preachy one at that . 0
 8195 there are many things that solid acting can do for a movie , but crafting something promising from a mediocre screenplay is not one of them . 2
 8196 a cautionary_tale about the folly of superficiality that is itself endlessly superficial . 1
 8197 it should be doing a lot of things , but does_n't . 0
 8198 i was hoping that it would be sleazy and fun , but it was neither . 2
 8199 the logic of it all will be greek to anyone not predisposed to the movie 's rude and crude humor . 0
 8200 about as big a crowdpleaser as they possibly come . 4
 8201 thumbs up to paxton for not falling into the hollywood trap and making a vanity project with nothing new to offer . 4
 8202 why `` they '' were here and what `` they '' wanted and quite honestly , i did_n't care . 1

 8205 the chocolate factory without charlie . 1
 8206 why , you may ask , why should you buy the movie milk when the tv cow is free ? 1
 8207 the trappings of i spy are so familiar you might as well be watching a rerun . 1
 8208 we 've liked klein 's other work but rollerball left us cold . 0
 8209 even on its own ludicrous terms , the sum of all_fears generates little narrative momentum , and invites unflattering comparisons to other installments in the ryan series . 0
 8210 but the actors make this worth a peek . 3
 8211 this mess of a movie is nothing short of a travesty of a transvestite comedy . 0
 8212 a determined , ennui-hobbled slog that really does_n't have much to say beyond the news flash that loneliness can make people act weird . 1
 8213 the satire is unfocused , while the story goes_nowhere . 0
 8214 easily the most thoughtful fictional examination of the root causes of anti-semitism ever_seen on screen . 4
 8215 conceptually brilliant ... plays_like a living-room war of the worlds , gaining most of its unsettling force from the suggested and the unknown . 3
 8216 i have to admit i walked out of runteldat . 0
 8217 less worrying about covering all the drama in frida 's life and more time spent exploring her process of turning pain into art would have made this a superior movie . 2
 8218 it 's excessively quirky and a little underconfident in its delivery , but otherwise this is the best ` old neighborhood ' project since christopher walken kinda romanced cyndi lauper in the opportunists . 3
 8219 this is a movie full of grace and , ultimately , hope . 4
 8220 -lrb- ferrera -rrb- has the charisma of a young_woman who knows_how to hold the screen . 4
 8221 we get an image of big papa spanning history , rather_than suspending it . 2
 8222 `` on guard ! '' 2
 8223 average , at best , i_'m afraid . 1
 8224 an eloquent , reflective and beautifully acted meditation_on both the profoundly devastating events of one year ago and the slow , painful healing process that has followed in their wake . 4
 8225 fortunately , elling never gets too cloying thanks to the actors ' perfect comic timing and sweet , genuine chemistry . 3
 8226 tully is worth a look for its true-to-life characters , its sensitive acting , its unadorned view of rural life and the subtle direction of first-timer hilary birmingham . 4
 8227 two badly interlocked stories drowned by all too clever complexity . 1
 8228 - i also wanted a little alien as a friend ! 3
 8229 it 's immensely ambitious , different than anything that 's been done before and amazingly successful in terms of what it 's trying to do . 4
 8230 forget the misleading title , what 's with the unexplained baboon cameo ? 1
 8231 though an important political documentary , this does not really make the case the kissinger should be tried as a war criminal . 1
 8232 not everyone will welcome or accept the trials of henry kissinger as faithful portraiture , but few can argue that the debate it joins is a necessary and timely one . 3
 8233 it 's always disappointing when a documentary fails to live up to -- or offer any new insight_into -- its chosen topic . 0
 8234 a frustrating ` tweener ' -- too slick , contrived and exploitative for the art houses and too cynical , small and decadent for the malls . 0
 8235 muddled , simplistic and more than a little pretentious . 0
 8236 the mothman prophecies is best when illustrating the demons bedevilling the modern masculine journey . 3
 8237 an oddity , to be sure , but one that you might wind up remembering with a degree of affection rather_than revulsion . 3
 8238 although bright , well-acted and thought-provoking , tuck everlasting suffers_from a laconic pace and a lack of traditional action . 2
 8239 feel free to go get popcorn whenever he 's not onscreen . 0
 8240 the very simple story seems too simple and the working out of the plot almost arbitrary . 0
 8241 -lrb- allen -rrb- manages to breathe life into this somewhat tired premise . 3
 8242 after a while , hoffman 's quirks and mannerisms , particularly his penchant for tearing up on cue -- things that seem so real in small doses -- become annoying and artificial . 1
 8243 there are flaws , but also stretches of impact and moments of awe ; we 're wrapped up in the characters , how they make their choices , and why . 3
 8244 who cares ? -rrb- . 1
 8245 while general audiences might not come away with a greater knowledge of the facts of cuban music , they 'll be treated to an impressive and highly entertaining celebration of its sounds . 4
 8246 exploitative and largely devoid of the depth or sophistication that would make watching such a graphic treatment of the crimes bearable . 1
 8247 a sentimental but entirely irresistible portrait of three aging sisters . 3
 8248 a typically observant , carefully nuanced and intimate french coming-of-age film that is an encouraging debut feature but has a needlessly downbeat ending that is too heavy for all that has preceded it . 2
 8249 good , solid storytelling . 4
 8250 as gory as the scenes of torture and self-mutilation may be , they are pitted against shimmering cinematography that lends the setting the ethereal beauty of an asian landscape painting . 4
 8251 we 're drawn in by the dark luster . 3
 8252 a pleasant , if forgettable , romp of a film . 2
 8253 a classic fairy tale that perfectly captures the wonders and worries of childhood in a way that few movies have ever approached . 4
 8254 congrats disney on a job well done , i enjoyed it just as much ! 4
 8255 some movies can get by without being funny simply by structuring the scenes as if they were jokes : a setup , delivery and payoff . 2
 8256 big time . 2
 8257 i wish it would have just gone more over-the-top instead of trying to have it both ways . 1
 8258 it just does_n't have anything really interesting to say . 1
 8259 ... would be a total loss if not for two supporting performances taking place at the movie 's edges . 2
 8260 cox is far more concerned with aggrandizing madness , not the man , and the results might drive you crazy . 2
 8261 a rather brilliant little cult item : a pastiche of children 's entertainment , superhero comics , and japanese animation . 3
 8262 oozes condescension from every pore . 2
 8263 clumsy , obvious , preposterous , the movie will likely set the cause of woman warriors back decades . 0
 8264 the result is an ` action film ' mired in stasis . 1
 8265 hollywood has taken quite a nosedive from alfred hitchcock 's imaginative flight to shyamalan 's self-important summer fluff . 1
 8266 takes a simple premise and carries it to unexpected heights . 4
 8267 it 's lost the politics and the social observation and become just another situation romance about a couple of saps stuck in an inarticulate screenplay . 1
 8268 the film 's plot may be shallow , but you 've never seen the deep like you see it in these harrowing surf shots . 3
 8269 this is a movie where the most notable observation is how long you 've been sitting still . 1
 8270 the film is hard to dismiss -- moody , thoughtful , and lit by flashes of mordant humor . 3
 8271 if jews were catholics , this would be catechism 2
 8272 hard , endearing , caring , warm . 4

 8274 boy , has this franchise ever run out of gas . 0
 8275 i 've_seen some bad singer-turned actors , but lil bow wow takes the cake . 1
 8276 follows the original film virtually scene for scene and yet manages to bleed it almost completely dry of humor , verve and fun . 1
 8277 a pathetically inane and unimaginative cross between xxx and vertical limit . 1
 8278 arteta paints a picture of lives lived in a state of quiet desperation . 3
 8279 shot largely in small rooms , the film has a gentle , unforced intimacy that never becomes claustrophobic . 4
 8280 but i had a lot of problems with this movie . 1
 8281 takes you by the face , strokes your cheeks and coos beseechingly at you : slow down , shake off your tensions and take this picture at its own breezy , distracted rhythms . 3
 8282 ... the plot weaves us into a complex web . 3
 8283 the messy emotions raging throughout this three-hour effort are instantly recognizable , allowing the film to paradoxically feel familiar and foreign at the same time . 2
 8284 plods along , minus the twisted humor and eye-popping visuals that have made miike ... a cult hero . 2
 8285 -lrb- the cockettes -rrb- provides a window into a subculture hell-bent on expressing itself in every way imaginable . ' 3
 8286 an exceptionally dreary and overwrought bit of work , every bit as imperious as katzenberg 's the prince of egypt from 1998 . 1
 8287 in its treatment of the dehumanizing and ego-destroying process of unemployment , time_out offers an exploration that is more accurate than anything i have seen in an american film . 3
 8288 renner carries much of the film with a creepy and dead-on performance . 4
 8289 ... if you_'re just in the mood for a fun -- but bad -- movie , you might want to catch freaks as a matinee . 2
 8290 feels like a cold old man going through the motions . 1
 8291 vampire epic succeeds as spooky action-packed trash of the highest order . 2
 8292 the film 's images give a backbone to the company and provide an emotional edge to its ultimate demise . 3
 8293 these three films form a remarkably cohesive whole , both visually and thematically , through their consistently sensitive and often exciting treatment of an ignored people . 4
 8294 hoffman waits too long to turn his movie in an unexpected direction , and even then his tone retains a genteel , prep-school quality that feels dusty and leatherbound . 1
 8295 the dirty jokes provide the funniest moments in this oddly sweet comedy about jokester highway patrolmen . 3
 8296 in a big corner office in hell , satan is throwing up his hands in surrender , is firing his r&d people , and has decided he will just screen the master of disguise 24\/7 . 0
 8297 a delicious , quirky movie with a terrific screenplay and fanciful direction by michael gondry . 4
 8298 it does_n't really know or care_about the characters , and uses them as markers for a series of preordained events . 1
 8299 jackson and co have brought back the value and respect for the term epic cinema . 3
 8300 the fourth `` pokemon '' is a diverting -- if predictable -- adventure suitable for a matinee , with a message that cautions children about disturbing the world 's delicate ecological balance . 3
 8301 supposedly authentic account of a historical event that 's far too tragic to merit such superficial treatment . 1
 8302 ... if you , like me , think an action film disguised as a war tribute is disgusting to begin with , then you_'re in for a painful ride . 0
 8303 ... a somber film , almost completely unrelieved by any comedy beyond the wistful everyday ironies of the working poor . 2
 8304 journalistically dubious , inept and often lethally dull . 0
 8305 he 's not good with people . 1
 8306 the sheer dumbness of the plot -lrb- other than its one good idea -rrb- and the movie 's inescapable air of sleaziness get you down . 0
 8307 it 's not a classic spy-action or buddy movie , but it 's entertaining enough and worth a look . 2
 8308 priggish , lethargically paced parable of renewal . 0
 8309 everything else about high_crimes is , like the military system of justice it portrays , tiresomely regimented . 2
 8310 warm in its loving yet unforgivingly inconsistent depiction of everyday people , relaxed in its perfect quiet pace and proud in its message . 4
 8311 an eye-boggling blend of psychedelic devices , special_effects and backgrounds , ` spy_kids 2 ' is a visual treat for all audiences . 3
 8312 `` the adventures of pluto nash '' is a big time stinker . 0
 8313 quite frankly , i ca_n't see why any actor of talent would ever work in a mcculloch production again if they looked at how this movie turned out . 0
 8314 it 's such a mechanical endeavor -lrb- that -rrb- it never bothers to question why somebody might devote time to see it . 1
 8315 and second , what 's with all the shooting ? 1
 8316 despite some strong performances , never_rises above the level of a telanovela . 1
 8317 ... best seen as speculative history , as much an exploration of the paranoid impulse as a creative sequel to the warren report . 2
 8318 rarely , indeed almost never , is such high-wattage brainpower coupled with pitch-perfect acting and an exquisite , unfakable sense of cinema . 4
 8319 there 's no clear picture of who killed bob crane . 2
 8320 payami tries to raise some serious issues about iran 's electoral process , but the result is a film that 's about as subtle as a party political broadcast . 1
 8321 the action here is unusually tame , the characters are too simplistic to maintain interest , and the plot offers few surprises . 1
 8322 the message is that even the most unlikely can link together to conquer all kinds of obstacles , whether they be of nature , of man or of one another . 2
 8323 merci pour le movie . 2
 8324 devos and cassel have tremendous chemistry -- their sexual and romantic tension , while never really vocalized , is palpable . 4
 8325 poignant and funny . 3
 8326 the overall vibe is druggy and self-indulgent , like a spring-break orgy for pretentious arts majors . 1
 8327 a glib but bouncy bit of sixties-style slickness in which the hero might wind up caught but the audience gets pure escapism . 3
 8328 the storylines are woven together skilfully , the magnificent swooping aerial shots are breathtaking , and the overall experience is awesome . 4
 8329 it finds no way to entertain or inspire its viewers . 1
 8330 with an unusual protagonist -lrb- a kilt-wearing jackson -rrb- and subject_matter , the improbable `` formula 51 '' is somewhat entertaining , but it could have_been much stronger . 3
 8331 director elie chouraqui , who co-wrote the script , catches the chaotic horror of war , but why bother if you_'re going to subjugate truth to the tear-jerking demands of soap_opera ? 1
 8332 is anyone else out there getting tired of the whole slo-mo , double-pistoled , ballistic-pyrotechnic hong_kong action aesthetic ? 1
 8333 it 's the humanizing stuff that will_probably sink the film for anyone_who does_n't think about percentages all day long . 1
 8334 a moving essay about the specter of death , especially suicide . 3
 8335 a disaster of a drama , saved only by its winged assailants . 1
 8336 when it comes out on video , then it 's the perfect cure for insomnia . 0
 8337 a beguiling evocation of the quality that keeps dickens evergreen : the exuberant openness with which he expresses our most basic emotions . 3
 8338 the movie should be credited with remembering his victims . 2
 8339 coupling disgracefully written dialogue with flailing bodily movements that substitute for acting , circuit is the awkwardly paced soap opera-ish story . 1
 8340 snipes relies too much on a scorchingly plotted dramatic scenario for its own good . 2
 8341 kurys seems intimidated by both her subject_matter and the period trappings of this debut venture into the heritage business . 1
 8342 the sweetest thing , a romantic_comedy with outrageous tendencies , may be a mess in a lot of ways . 2
 8343 has its moments -- and almost as many subplots . 3
 8344 a chilly , brooding but quietly resonant psychological study of domestic tension and unhappiness . 3
 8345 smart and fun , but far more witty than it is wise . 3
 8346 succeeds where its recent predecessor miserably fails because it demands that you suffer the dreadfulness of war from both_sides . 3
 8347 a rare and lightly entertaining look behind the curtain that separates comics from the people laughing in the crowd . 4
 8348 high_crimes steals so freely from other movies and combines enough disparate types of films that it ca_n't_help but engage an audience . 3
 8349 michel piccoli 's moving performance is this films reason for being . 3
 8350 purposefully shocking in its eroticized gore , if unintentionally dull in its lack of poetic frissons . 0
 8351 an intimate contemplation of two marvelously messy lives . 3
 8352 the party scenes deliver some tawdry kicks . 2
 8353 meandering and glacially paced , and often just_plain dull . 2
 8354 a fake street drama that keeps telling you things instead of showing them . 1
 8355 a quietly moving look back at what it was to be iranian-american in 1979 . 3
 8356 confuses its message with an ultimate desire to please , and contorting itself into an idea of expectation is the last thing any of these three actresses , nor their characters , deserve . 0
 8357 ... a good film that must have baffled the folks in the marketing department . 4
 8358 ... its solemn pretension prevents us from sharing the awe in which it holds itself . 1
 8359 but ` why ? ' 2
 8360 denis forges out of the theories of class - based rage and sisterly obsession a razor-sided tuning fork that rings with cultural , sexual and social discord . 2
 8361 if_you value your time and money , find an escape clause and avoid seeing this trite , predictable rehash . 0
 8362 while most films these_days are about nothing , this film seems to be about everything that 's plaguing the human spirit in a relentlessly globalizing world . 3
 8363 she boxes these women 's souls right open for us . 3
 8364 in his u.s. debut , mr. schnitzler proves himself a deft pace master and stylist . 4
 8365 sex with strangers is fascinating ... 4
 8366 it made me feel unclean , and i_'m the guy who liked there 's something about mary and both american pie movies . 0
 8367 anyone who 's ever suffered under a martinet music instructor has no_doubt fantasized about what an unhappy , repressed and twisted personal life their tormentor deserved . 2
 8368 just a collection of this and that -- whatever fills time -- with no unified whole . 1
 8369 and it 's a lousy one at that . 0
 8370 not one moment in the enterprise did_n't make me want to lie down in a dark room with something cool to my brow . 2
 8371 it gets bogged down by hit-and-miss topical humour before getting to the truly good stuff . 2
 8372 between bursts of automatic gunfire , the story offers a trenchant critique of capitalism . 3
 8373 in addition to gluing you to the edge of your_seat , changing lanes is also a film of freshness , imagination and insight . 4
 8374 lasker 's canny , meditative script distances sex and love , as byron and luther ... realize they ca_n't get no satisfaction without the latter . 3
 8375 this angst-ridden territory was covered earlier and much better in ordinary people . 1
 8376 a smart little indie . 3
 8377 my only wish is that celebi could take me back to a time before i_saw this movie and i could just skip it . 0
 8378 imagine kevin smith , the blasphemous bad boy of suburban jersey , if he were stripped of most of his budget and all of his sense of humor . 0
 8379 this film is not a love letter for the slain rappers , it 's a taunt - a call for justice for two crimes from which many of us have not yet recovered . 2
 8380 whether you like it or not is basically a matter of taste . 2
 8381 the best way to describe it is as a cross between paul thomas anderson 's magnolia and david lynch 's mulholland dr. 2
 8382 harmlessly 3
 8383 after a while , the only way for a reasonably intelligent person to get through the country_bears is to ponder how a whole segment of pop-music history has been allowed to get wet , fuzzy and sticky . 1
 8384 a powerful performance from mel gibson and a brutal 90-minute battle sequence that does everything but issue you a dog-tag and an m-16 . 4
 8385 so much about the film is loopy and ludicrous ... that it could have_been a hoot in a bad-movie way if the laborious pacing and endless exposition had been tightened . 1
 8386 by the time the plot grinds itself out in increasingly incoherent fashion , you might be wishing for a watch that makes time go faster rather_than the other way around . 0
 8387 director tom shadyac and star kevin costner glumly mishandle the story 's promising premise of a physician who needs to heal himself . 1
 8388 it 's a big idea , but the film itself is small and shriveled . 1
 8389 some fine acting , but ultimately a movie with no reason for being . 1
 8390 the movie has no respect for laws , political correctness or common decency , but it displays something more important : respect for its flawed , crazy people . 2
 8391 the film lapses too often into sugary sentiment and withholds delivery on the pell-mell pyrotechnics its punchy style promises . 1
 8392 one well-timed explosion in a movie can be a knockout , but a hundred of them can be numbing . 1
 8393 a dark , dull thriller with a parting shot that misfires . 2

 8439 gibney and jarecki just want to string the bastard up . 2
 8440 lazily directed by charles stone iii ... from a leaden script by matthew cirulnick and novelist thulani davis . 1
 8441 nonchalantly freaky and uncommonly pleasurable , warm water may well be the year 's best and most unpredictable comedy . 4

 8455 and as with most late-night bull sessions , eventually the content is n't nearly as captivating as the rowdy participants think it is . 1
 8456 the kind of sweet-and-sour insider movie that film buffs will eat up like so much gelati . 4
